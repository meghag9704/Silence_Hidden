The moments you wish last a lifetime are mere seconds but when you think back to them and how you felt in that moment, everything changes, you feel light again, transported back to that time when you were so happy.\n",

My entire soul was uplifted, I felt like I was floating. And for the most part I did — I floated through life. I was so so so happy.\n",

After all - I did this to myself - isolated from the group of friends, unwilling to partake and be a part of the smaller inner group. I did this to myself. Then why am I still sad? Then why am I still mad? Why do I feel this FOMO? This willingness to put up a charade. Put up all my walls and not let anyone into this fortress?\n",

      "There is apparently a certain novelty to being single in college—especially Spring quarter. Its almost as if, all the couples have come out of hiding because you see more of them on the quad, on Red Square. You see them holding hands and a clear sign of PDA. For other people its like being single is the greatest thing they have thought of. For those who have been in a relationship (even if its on-and-off) since fall quarter, they are tired of the seasonal changes and want to embrace the independence. Then there is the people who are sex-crazed and don’t want to be tied down. I am not sure how many people make up my category but I am single, barely been kissed, girl who just wants a relationship. Who just wants a person to need them and keep them company. I am not asking for much, but apparently its so hard to be loved that I have given up.\n",

I know there are 5 months of the quarter left and then 4 long months of vacations. What’s worse when one of your best friends has a line of boys almost as if the universe tells the boys she knows that she is currently single or going to be very soon. And even before she s done with one, sh has another primed and ready to parade in. She doesn’t need the boys, but sh has them as a back up for when she does.

And I think about how long it took me to open up and how I might ever open up again and I am baffled. The funny thing is I keep looking at how my life should be that I forget to look at how my life is now. I am loved and cherished and people care about me. It’s more than I could have ever asked and it makes my heart so full. I forget to love myself because I am too busy loving others. I am too busy waiting for their approval but really I’m the one who got me here. Yet somehow I keep questioning my worth and my strength. I brought myself here from those dark days.

I had one of those today. 0.25 miles into a hike, I felt like I couldn’t breathe, my heart constricted, and I felt like I was going to die, and then I started thinking about how it’s the end of July, and I don’t really have a job and I don’t know what I am doing honestly. This week has been such a shitshow with me barely working on anything and it was bad. \n",

Sometimes, regardless of how great things are going, it gets messy and loud. But in between all of that we get caught up in our monotony, we forget to find color, we forget to smile with our hearts.\n",
      "This past year taught me about trusting myself.\n",
      "Recently, I go to bed thinking of one picture, of one moment that put a smile on my face - may that have been a conversation with a barista who's name I never bothered to know, a silly afternoon sitting in an overpriced cafe, waking up on a flight in the midst of a beautiful sunrise, sitting by the ocean watching a mesmirizing sunset. Or most of all, times with my friends. Thinking back I am washed over with a wave of calmness. I am transported to the place I was in, to the way it felt, tasted, sounded, smelt. I can hear the waves crashing, the laughter of people, the blaring music. I can taste the burnt coffee. I can feel the unconscious smile that has resided over my face.\n",
      "And I feel complete. I feel invincible. And I feel thankful. Thankful for the happiness in the world, happiness in my life. It makes me yearn for more moments like those. And I want to be more present, more aware of those moments. I want to take the time to savour those moments in the future. Because they come and go too fast. And then you're left again in a dark room, typing on your laptop years later.\n",
      "Thinking back to those moments gives me a sense of calm. I know I can never go back and I know I can never recreate that moment. I know I am looking at some of them with rose-tinted glasses, zooming into that one fleeting minute of pure ecstasy. But sometimes, playing and replaying that on loop gets you through life. I feel like that's what I have been doing.\n",

New York does have a high supply as compared to demand of jobs which may be a problem, but Seattle hasn’t proven any better.

But either way putting all of that apart, and considering that cost of living will be more expensive in nyc than Seattle, is it stupid to just uproot your life and move to this place that I have wanted to live in for so long.

In those quiet times, when you’ve felt like there is nothing to talk about, I am sorry for being disengaged because my brain won’t shut up.

It sounds perfect. I cam back home that saturday evening, made myself dinner, got into bed, and cried. I didn’t feel anything, i felt hollow but I knew I was crying because of the wet tears rolling down my face. There was a nagging voice in my head — go to that damn party, go see people, you’re running out of time. But all I could do was lay there, unable to move, and the dark thoughts just kept coming.\n",

I am afraid of putting myself up here and talking about this and I am afraid of what will happen when I wake up tomorrow. I am afraid of the pitiness and the tears and the smiles. People ask me why I don’t put myself out there more. Why I like to play it safe and just do what I am doing. Its so that I can stay a little sane.

I don’t know how to pick up a phone and say ‘I feel like killing myself, can you come over please.’ But I know I can and I promise that is enough for me. I am sorry if I am not vulnerable enough but please know each and every one of you matter so much to me and I love you all. I don’t say that lightly, ‘love,’ I truly do mean it.

I lay in bed with my eyes closed, feeling alone, and with my thoughts, they all come back. The heartbreak, the wells of tears, the fears. I don't know how to move past it. I've tried. I've tried to talk to myself rationally and tried to think it through. But my self-preservation tactic kicks in on its own, and it screams. And I shut down. Its all dark.\n",

That's what I haven't figured out. That's the part I can't seem to figure out — me. And me wanting to breathe, me wanting to get up in the morning. When I was 17, I didn't think I would make it to 23. But if I did make it to 23, I thought of myself having left behind all of this.\n",
      "I think voicing this, telling someone this will help me. I know it will. But I am scared. I don't know for what but I am scared. And then another voice in me tells me that I know what others will say. I know exactly what advice they will give me — to fucking shut up and deal with it and move on. So what's the point. But really, how do you tell someone this? I can't even fathom sitting down and having this conversation with someone. Not my parents, not my sister, not my family. My friends love me but I just don't want to burden them with this. And that brings up the whole childhood, trust issues, trauma. The idea that people are there in good times, but not the bad.\n",
      "Good times and not the bad — that's another idea where my self-preervation instincts kick in. People always said it matters that people stand by you in your bad times, not the good. But then I had people leave in my bad times. When I told them of my needs and wasn't able to hold only theirs, they stopped being my friend. And it happened, over and over again. Until I became desensititzed. I dealt with it and realized if I can't have them stand by me in bad times, at least they will stand be me in good times. And then comes around my birthday, and no one remembers. and there we go with that theory. People don't stand with you in good times either. At the end of the day, you really are a fucking lonely mess that you have to deal with, no one else. And so my preservation instincts kick in and I try my damned hardest to not shut down but it happens. And when it can't happen, I snap.\n",
      "How do you tell someone you love this? Someone that gave birth to you? Someone you love? I don't have that much courage. I know this knowledge will break their heart, they will look at me differently. And so, I don't tell them. I don't tell anyone. I live with it. I pick myself apart and glue myself together. I think about how I did it now and I will do it again. And then one day I wake up and its alright, I am not going to break, and then the next comes and I feel steady ground and I can prepare for lift off. And I fill like a hot air balloon and slowly rise, taking in the scenes. And then one stupid bird with a sharp beak comes and punctures a tiny bubble, and its off to my death I go. I crash faster than I rose and I break apart into more pieces than last time. And the whole cycle begins again. I put myself together, glue it piee by piece. Again and again and again. But now, I odn't know how much longer I cna go with this. I can feel the small fine dust is lost and I can see the cracks. I can see the balloon is unpatchable because its so distorted. And I am worried one day I will blow and I will be irreparable. I worry about that day.\n",

The idea that you can't burden someone else with your burden. The concept of being one perosn on the outside without ever truly showing just how broken you are on the inside is one I've struggled with for most of my conscious adult life. At least from the age of 12. and now, I don't know another way.\n",

I don’t even know what else to say but it’s this absolute utter beautiful feeling of freedom that I absolutely love and am going to miss.\n",

      "I strongly believe their somethings that you have to learn outside of class. While in London I took part in multiple societies and clams while I was studying English literature. I was part of creative pro bono agency as well as a Tech society. I went to multiple hackathons both on campus and off-campus hoping to gain as much information as possible. Over the summer while working with Vernacular.AI not only did I work with use experience and data I also worked with the CTO in learning the basic architecture of How Machine learning works and the architecture of their software working in the small team. Working in the small team really helped build my perspective alongside that I worked on multiple freelancing projects over the summer and then personally the next step. I wish to play the Google because in my opinion the next step I need is a structured guidance that but only a big company can provide in particular. Most importantly I want to be able to work under a team of advisors to tell me how I can approach things differently I am. I have always been very learning individual and I believe working with professionals in creating something bigger but I had to word a bigger project is the ultimate next step for my future. Will put me a part. What puts me apart from other individuals is my drive and passion for attack. Combined with the articulate knowledge of understanding and overthinking that an English degree provides. While at college I have continued to take web design courses and you Xclusive as pie as part of my informatics my alarm I hope in the next coming year I hope to convert convert my minor into a major.\n",

      "I sat there listening to her talk and I had no idea what was running through her mind but as she talked about her broken pieces,6 I felt it deep within me. My experiences were completely different from hers but there was something in her pain that I felt. Something about the way she described about her broken pieces, her immovability, her lack of self esteem and personal confidence. I felt her pain like I felt mine. Talking to her and watching her in that state reminded me of the pain I was in about 2 years ago. Here I was, talking to someone twice my age about abuse and while hers was physical in a relationship, I understood her because I was in friendships that were abusive. Friendships that broke down my self esteem with every passing year. I felt her broken pieces and her loneliness. Her pain is very different from mine, very emotionally draining from mine. But the effect—the effect was intersectional. The pain and feelings we feel are one and the same, because that’s what depression does to you. \n",

      "He was the kindest person I knew. Thinking about forgiveness makes me think of him. It’s funny,though, how we think about people after their passing. How a sadness brings people together. It wasn’t that I didn’t think of him when he was alive, rather it was the fact that I took it for granted. I took life for granted. But I swear, this thing is far too short and far too cruel. It comes to the people who deserve it the least and who probably want it the least too. It’s almost his birthday and I can’t stop thinking about it. My nana was the nicest person ever & I want to be just a little nice as him. Without me knowing it, he taught me the importance of forgiveness & the importance of self-worth.\n",

      "I think sometimes we think we can sit down and just figure everything out and that it all has to line up and it’s going to be ok. But it’s not how it works. It takes time and effort and energy to build yourself up. It takes an approach of recognizing your vices and constantly working on ourselves. We are a more conscious generation and I think that’s because of the amount of time we spend working on ourselves, to better ourselves.\n",
      "I think we try to find a reason for why we’re broken and we try to blame specific instances in our life for them. Sometimes it’s nothing but other times it’s everything. How do you reconcile with who you are and who you are becoming?\n",
      "My mom is going through perimenopause which makes her anger absolutely horrible. Mix that with her sadness and it’s kind of unbearable to be around her. But one of the things I’ve found myself saying is ‘calm down,’ ‘keep yourself calm,’ ‘control yourself.’ It’s that last one that really makes me think — ‘control yourself’ woman — a jibe hundreds and thousands of men have used towards women to make them feel inferior and less. Is it fair for one woman to use towards another woman?\n",
      "There is a rawness to vulnerability that I haven’t been able to come to terms with. How do you keep pushing yourself and your self worth when you are so confused and overwhelmed? Isn’t it time to ask myself what I want? What I truly want? Am I wasting time?\n",
      "That question — am I wasting time? — has been replaying in my head for the past 6 months. I keep seeing people get amazing jobs and positions out of college. I keep seeing people party and have fun. And in all honesty, it’s hitting me hard. I didn’t want that life right now but is this the life I wanted? Sitting in my bed all day, not working on anything? Where is my ambition? I am broken and I feel even more broken when I see this. When will I stop measuring myself to others in the world and just focus on me — focus on what I want — on where I want to be? Isn’t this the time to do that?\n",

      "Being back in Bangalore has been very interesting for me. I knew I never fit in in high school, but I kept telling myself stories and others how close I was to some people so that I could make it up. Honestly, I am tired of it. I am tired of lying to myself and others around me. I don’t like some people and they don’t like me. But honestly, I never put in the effort it needed.\n",
      "So, I’ve been sitting here worrying about what I am going to do on New Years because no 22 year old should spend it at home. I should go out and see my friends and drink with them and enjoy and live my best life. Right? That’s what’s tradition demands. That’s what’s expected. When people ask me what I did, I have to tell them I got all dressed up and went to a party with my high school friends and had fun. Because that’s what happens, isn’t it? But it isn’t what I want to do. I am sitting here and constantly thinking and stressing about it, because I don’t want to be that “loser” but honestly I don’t want to go drink with random people. I think I want to be invited to it more than I want to go to it. But what’s new? That’s how I have lived most of my life. In this halfway place between dreams and consciousness.\n",
      "I am able to stand here today and I know that there is something wrong with me. I know that but I don’t know how to help myself. I am still terrified to face my demons.\n",
      "The following are pieces from my journal from July 2022 to present about quality of living.\n",
      "\n",
      "The narratives that we tell ourselves in exchange for the fear of living life and feeling emotions. \n",
      "All I've ever wanted is a community of people that support and love my endeavors. \n",
      "I am so caught up in things of elsewhere - the past, another place, another time, another scenario that I forget to exist in the now, the present. \n",
      "I don't have people around me who have the mindset that I am in currently - need to find that. \n",
      "My room is still a heaping blazing disaster zone. \n",
      "The simple pleasures are the little: subway rides late at night with friends, musicians on the subway, watching the sun set. \n",
      "Finally I am in a position where I can say I love and believe in myself. \n",
      "Not showing up. Isn't friendship about showing up? About putting aside this anxiety? I am in a rut and I can never get out of it. I feel like I am choosing myself but I'm hiding. Isn't it courage to go? To show? To risk? Isn't that what life is -- the people you meet and the stories you accumulate?\n",
      "I've wanted to die for so long that I'm glad to live today. To know that I've made it to an age I didn't think I would, to acknowledge the greed and pain and sadness that I had in life. That it wasn't a part of my imagination. To have the knowledge that I will experience all of it again maybe worse but I will have more control.\n",
      "I am filled with love and gratitude and greatness today. I feel invincible. \n",
      "I don't know where my time and energy has gone. \n",
      "I've been leading unto this moment of release. \n",
      "I don't know what I've been feeling. I feel restless. I feel anxious. I feel - expectant. \n",
      "In the winter, when the snow falls quickly, for a second when the weather turns, it does something where we can't see far from our window. We can imagine that we aren't where we are. Maybe the city isn't the city and the building my window is facing is actually a mountain, a bit farther than it appears, each with its own cottage, neatly stacked. \n",
      "I was shook because I was giving the impression that I had no family trauma. How is it so easy for someone to diminish another's trauma? I don't talk about the trauma because I don't see the point in talking about it. It's easier to talk about the good things because the bad is horrible.\n",
      "Looking at photos of myself as a child I am always struck by how I used to smile. But in some photos, I look at them and am transported back to how I was feeling. Was it then - when I was 7 - that I stopped being happy? The expression in this undiscovered photo says it all. \n",
      "Am I just incapable of saying no? \n",

      "Its true  there are good things  And i wish I could just count those good things  But its the bad things  the difficult things that haunt me everyday  Every night  I lay in bed with my eyes closed  feeling alone  and with my thoughts  they all come back  The heartbreak  the wells of tears  the fears  I don t know how to move past it  I ve tried  I ve tried to talk to myself rationally and tried to think it through  But my self preservation tactic kicks in on its own  and it screams  And I shut down  Its all dark \n",
      "What I ve not figured out — is me  I thought I would be happy when I was 23  I thought I wouldn t have my dark demon  I thought I would smile and laugh and be light and carefree  That s what I haven t figured out  That s the part I can t seem to figure out — me  And me wanting to breathe  me wanting to get up in the morning  When I was 17  I didn t think I would make it to 23  But if I did make it to 23  I thought of myself having left behind all of this \n",
      "I think voicing this  telling someone this will help me  I know it will  But I am scared  I don t know for what but I am scared  And then another voice in me tells me that I know what others will say  I know exactly what advice they will give me — to fucking shut up and deal with it and move on  So what s the point  But really  how do you tell someone this  I can t even fathom sitting down and having this conversation with someone  Not my parents  not my sister  not my family  My friends love me but I just don t want to burden them with this  And that brings up the whole childhood  trust issues  trauma  The idea that people are there in good times  but not the bad \n",
      "Good times and not the bad — that s another idea where my self preervation instincts kick in  People always said it matters that people stand by you in your bad times  not the good  But then I had people leave in my bad times  When I told them of my needs and wasn t able to hold only theirs  they stopped being my friend  And it happened  over and over again  Until I became desensititzed  I dealt with it and realized if I can t have them stand by me in bad times  at least they will stand be me in good times  And then comes around my birthday  and no one remembers  and there we go with that theory  People don t stand with you in good times either  At the end of the day  you really are a fucking lonely mess that you have to deal with  no one else  And so my preservation instincts kick in and I try my damned hardest to not shut down but it happens  And when it can t happen  I snap \n",

      "To me silence means stillness. Silence means not creation disturbance. Silence can be at different levels though. Could be silence in your actions, words, thoughts or inner being. Just because your words are silent doesn’t mean other parts of you are silent. But the deeper the silence goes the more clarity is created out of the stillness. If there is silence on the outside but not on the inside, it will mean misalignment and internal conflict.\n",
      "i think silence is subjective; it can be saying what people want to hear while keeping everything you actually want to say quiet, it can be staying completely silent when your mind is the loudest thing ever, being a bystander. There are so many manifestations of silence and all of it is based on personal experience, but to me personally, silence is that feeling you get when you’re in a room full of people and you feel completely alone, when your mind is racing with thoughts to the point it becomes a numbing silence in your head. \n",
      "no noise/words, and having stony faces\n",
      "Silence is just being comfortable without distractions, which happens so rarely.\n",
      "Silence could mean reflection, just letting something sink in or truly giving space for words, actions, feelings expressed to be heard by you and others around you. \n",
      "the things I had a hard time saying to my mother \n",
      "Silence means keeping things within me when I know I shouldn't say it. \n",
      "No sound, absence of sound \n",
      "First there is a still clear silent lake. Nothing is changing. Millions of years it’s been like that. You drop a water, a drop of water, means it has to be a mass, suppose you drop a stone or a big drop of water, the whole lake will get disturbed. The silence of the lake will be broken. And it is going to keep on breaking the silence but if you’re at the bottom, hardly anything will happen to it, unless its so explosive, the silence cannot be broken. It is the bottom of the lake. Let’s reverse it for the human mind. Our human mind is fluttering like one drop, “Haye mere Baal kharab ho Gaye, haaye mera chehra aisa nahi hai, aare mere naak aisi nahi hai.” So we are all getting, the silence if being broken by our thought processes by our physical and external stimuli so much  unless you make it calm and quiet and go to the bottom then we can realize our own self. That is maha rishi’s perpetuity concept. Silence. \n",
      "Silence takes up space or the lack of space. It is a private space. what are you thinking about? Brains and thoughts that you don’t have access to. Today there is a total lack of boundaries. I appreciate boundaries. When I interview people I fill silences so people have time to think. You have to be socially adept to understand the power of silence. Take pauses and think before revealing the answers. Curating ourselves and experiences intentionally. As a way to be intentional and take back power. A private place to go to. \n",
      "power & intentionality. Deciding when and what I want to share means reclaiming power over my presence in a space. It's one of the most empowering things I can do for myself when I'm entering a space I feel uncomfortable in. Its an act of self care too to be able to not allow people access to your thoughts and words rather than feeling like we owe it to people to keep talking to make them comfortable, or to answer questions even if they feel intrusive. It also means being able to pause and think about what I want to say, which has a meditative aspect that forces me to slow down when I'm in an anxious spiral where I can't stop talking, and allows me to not say things I regret later.\n",
      "silence means chaos. it's hard for me to be silent because all my thoughts come flooding in. so really, it's my loudest moment.\n",
      "Quite literally the absence of noise; for someone who talks a lot it also sometimes correlates with a little but of uncomfortable moments. Silence for me personally is also thinking time; when I am not verbalising my thoughts and i come across as silent but i have so much running in my mind. \n",
      "Silence is ambiguous to me. It can both be concentration, collaboration and a sense of focusing on something to the extend that talking is unnecessary. It can be peaceful and with contentment. It’s often said that when you can be together in silence with someone else in silence, it’s really special. I would agree. On the other hand, I find silence oppressive at times; when I don’t know how to say certain things, when feelings are soaring around my body with no words. In those instances silence can be really difficult and frustrating.\n",
      "Things I skip to say, leaving it to be an awkward pause but skipping some moments of embarrassment \n",
      "Not communicating at all; revealing only partial information; not speaking up when necessary; not responding to someone's needs\n",
      "Silence for me has many meanings, and I would assign each of them a different color. For example, sometimes it's comforting to have its presence, this is when it comes from a place of understanding, I would tag it with an off-white color, whereas sometimes it puts you on a guilt trip when there is uncertainty, and lack of communication, so I would tag it with a dark shade of gray. \n",
      "\"Silence can have different meanings depending on the context. It can be a moment of tranquility, peace, and stillness, providing an opportunity for reflection, introspection, and relaxation. Silence can also be a form of respect, allowing others to express themselves without interruption or interference. It can be a way to listen actively, paying attention to others and the environment, fostering understanding and connection.\n",
      "On the other hand, silence can also signify discomfort, awkwardness, or tension in social situations, where unspoken emotions or thoughts may be present. It can represent a lack of communication or a breakdown in dialogue, potentially signifying misunderstandings or conflicts. Silence can also be associated with secrecy, reservation, or hidden emotions, where unexpressed thoughts or feelings may be kept concealed.\n",
      "To me silence is peace. To me silence is comfort. But at the same time, silence also means being silenced to me. To be stripped of the basic right of expressing yourself the way you deserve to. Silence to me is order and chaos all at once. At times all you need is silence to make sense of the chaos happening in and around you, and sometimes you need the same silence to be broken to ensue some much needed chaos. \n",
      "Silence means listening. Listening deepl so that I can find spaces to smile. \n",
      "Silence is a universal language. It is the liminal negative space that exists for the sublime to occur. \n",
      "Sometimes it's that crazy tension between two people, sometimes it's a calm environment where you feel safe, and sometimes it's loneliness.\n",
      "Silence is to not think\n",
      "It means being my truest version of myself\n",
      "Silence scares me a little because it can make me feel alone. At the same time, I feel that silence helps me become more centered and in tune with myself, even if it’s uncomfortable at first.\n",
      "\"Silence can be a way of fitting in. Of resting, not fighting a battle to be heard or understand. The relief of going unnoticed and not causing any friction. \n",
      "Sometimes it’s also comfortable, especially when experiencing a star lit night, the sea or just reading a book, doing our own things around other people. \"\n",
      "Not having an inner dialogue or having a thought. Having it be quiet around me. \n",
      "Quiet time to think, awkward moments in the air, pause before a blow out fight, scary movies\n",
      "Silence is stillness \n",
      "When you are engaged with nothing. Total zero space. No chattered with people. Meditative state. Focused on one singular thing. \n",
      "Negative space but also the thing that exists all around you. \n",
      "Stillness and calm \n",
      "Comfort and being in the interdependence. Learning about somebody through silent ways and how you can be. \n",
      "Silence is comfort and knowing how to love and being interdependent. \n",
      "Silence can be a choice, imposed, it's not passive. It's active always. There is no passivity in it, although by definition or by effect it seems passive, especially if you're intentional with your silence.  But then silence is also a gift, you're listening, you're processing. I don't think silence, I don't know what we're mapping, how the other end is, but whatever it is, the absence of noise to noise, I don't think one has weight over the other. I think that is situational. When silence is imposed, it can be imposed, it can be oppressive. When silence is imposed its imposed. When you aren't silent you have to think about volume, amplification and reach, and the dynamics of when you break silence, where does that go. What does silence look like? Is it a physical structure around you that is restricting you? Is it mental, because most of the time it is mental. Your silence is feeding the disorder itself, you're not feeding yourself, you're feeding it everytime you let it do. Self-inflicted silence is hard to grasp sometimes. \n",
      "Silence to me is the removal or void of sound\n",
      "Honestly I don't like too much of silence. I would link silence with meditation, focus or concentration. The meaning of silence has evolved over time. In childhood it was equivalent to \"calm before the storm\" . As I grew up, I understood that silence could also be comforting. And in my current life stage it is about peace of mind . \n",
      "Everything. I spend 80% of my day in silence and I have even chose to live in a property where I have access to a lot of silence. I dont like the hustle and noise on the roads and Im not big on travelling either. I like doing deep work and work can be anything. If you meet me, you wondnt call me an introvert and nor am I an introvert. Its just that I believe my thoughts are precious and I can only access the full potential of my thoughts when there is silence around.\n",
      "Silence is both a boon and a bane. It is the representation of both comfort and anger depending on who the person is. When by myself, silence is peaceful and like homecoming to me. \n",
      "Peace, rest, moments of introspection, the state of being alone and at times loneliness \n",
      "\"It means so many things and is not strictly auditory. And these things can be contradictory. For one, it can feel uncomfortable or peaceful. Or you can feel silence when you are in a loud locale. Personally, it’s most powerful when (1) nothing is interrupting my internal monologue, and (2) when this monologue is a peaceful, inspired, and creative. As is probably obvious, my dominant feelings about silence are positive. \n",
      "But when with other people it’s strange that silence can seem so hostile and awkward, and an anxiety stimulant. Or in other contexts, it can mean something detrimental-say, silencing voices that need to be heard.\"\n",
      "emptiness, the lack of something, almost hollow\n",
      "silence means being very peaceful and present and a quiet mind, I think being able to embrace silence is a really valuable skill in 2023 given how many mechanisms there are to avoid silence, and also it can be more of a \"state of mind\" rather than literal silence - for example I feel like I am able to have \"inner silence\" even on a busy subway or busy nyc street I silence the things I don’t think are acceptable to be said openly. I silence myself from saying things that I think might hurt people. I silence the part of myself that I think others might not relate to. \n",
      "There are so many parts of myself that i silence and i think it depends on who i am talking to. It changes from person to person, the person i am to family is not the same as the one i am to my friends, and this is a byproduct of silence the parts that need to be silenced when i am with certain groups of people. \n",
      "parts of myself that i am insecure about i hide. \n",
      "I'm thinking about the ways in which I perform in friendships and why I am silent about the ways in which I silence the things that aren't going well so I don't seem like the debby downer and don't bring down the group's vibe but I'm not being honest and truthful about how I am and I think it's a suffocating silence and one that feels very self-betraying. There's so much comfort with people you know but it also has so many learned boundaries over time that sometimes it feels easy to open up to a stranger in a way that you can't with a close friend because they might be involved or have passed judgement previously. It's taken me a long time to be comfortable in silence with anyone other than my partner/old roommates, but when it happens it's the best feeling.\n",
      "Silence for me represents the feeling of understanding. Having moved around and not always fit it, I used to be forced into being silent since no one would engage with me. This would manifest into anxiety and almost over corrective form of speaking, talking and engaging with others around yourself to make sure it is not you being rejected by them this time around. It can be very stressful and panic enduring to always have something to say, and also can come off as over sharing thinking back on it. Which is why silence with friends and partners can mean comfort for some as well! \n",
      "I never told my parents about my eating disorder \n",
      "I type up messages that I never press send on. When I miss someone I open up their old text messages and type up a message but never press send on it. \n",

      "People aren’t entitled to our thoughts and reactions and remove yourself from the situation \n",
      "I think silence can be a manipulative act (not in a bad way) between strangers, and a way to set boundaries. By choosing what we want to reveal and what we leave unsaid we paint a picture of how we want to be perceived. Those that know us can see through that barrier easily, those that don't can't. The things I leave unsaid between friends are either things I know they can infer without me saying anything, or as a preventative measure if there are things I know may hurt them. It's interesting to think about silence through generations. We do not have a lot of family history because nobody ever bothered to write it down or to pass down stories through generations, and so silence has erased the past in many ways, with each death a tidal wave that removes the footprints from the beach. That silence has made me work harder to fill in the blanks, with the scraps that I do know or through my imagination. My mother has always remained mysterious and elusive to me. She was a master of not revealing details, or casually saying things that carried a lot of weight, but doing it in passing as though what she said was nothing of importance at all. In turn I grew up to be a very chatty person, and a person that word vomits personal information in every conversation, and I think that maybe the reason I do this is to leave a bread crumb trail. Maybe I'm scared that my footprints will be washed away, or maybe I'm hoping someone will follow the breadcrumb trail right back to who I am at my core because I felt like I never got the chance to do that with my parents\n",
      "i silence my weaknesses. I don't share it unless I absolutely have to.\n",
      "I am definitely not a fan of silence; but I dont mean constant talk - even some white noise, the fan moving or even some traffic noises. With people around: sometimes silence is necessary but a lot of times it makes me feel more conscious.\n",
      "I think silences were the norm in previous generations. I have seen equations where things that were to be addressed were ignored and in turn just became emotional baggage that effects them years later. I think in the current generation its an active choice - when do I choose to be silent and when does it do me more harm - be it in personal equations or even when standing up for your values on the internet.\n",
      "I often silence my opinions or my wishes and needs. Maybe I don’t think they’re important. I don’t always do this, but it’s certainly a pattern. \n",
      "I think intrusive thoughts are left unsaid, sometimes confessed out of guilt; the idea of your identity and confusions around it, especially if you're on the LGBTQ+ spectrum\n",
      "People stay silence because of a number of reasons - fear of being judged; fear of the other person's reaction or inability to handle certain facts or truths; fear of offending someone or calling them out on something; staying silent in order to avoid conflict altogether;  \n",
      "People are naturally more likely to stay silent in situations involving unknown people they've just met since they are generally not aware of the person's background/are not sure of their opinions and values/don't want to offend them/would rather just avoid any possible conflict or disagreement. For people you've known for a long time, its much easier to open up and share without being judged; its easier to address issues that you might not be ok with; its easier to empathize and understand by speaking out.\n",
      "I have recently realized withdrawing from the everyday events of life. It's challenging to silence my thoughts, because that is an internal process, but I have found myself limiting interaction with people I like talking with, including my family members.\n",
      "Why do people hide parts of themselves? Maybe because they do not want to be judged based on a certain perception. This could be a phase, but having different opinions from multiple people is overwhelming at times.\n",
      "Sometimes I choose to silence my true emotions or thoughts when communicating with others. There are various situations when I chose to remain silent but the primary reason is usually a desire to avoid conflict. Sometimes it's just easier to not speak your mind and avoid confrontation. It's a matter of picking one's battles. This often happens with people I've known for longer, or older adults who might misinterpret my words/expression.\n",
      "When it comes to social situations, the things that are left unspoken to a stranger often stem from a desire to maintain personal boundaries and protect myself from being vulnerable. How much I reveal depends on the situation and I choose to remain silent if I feel that the conversation is getting too personal too fast.\n",
      "Silence can also be influenced by generational or cultural norms. In some cultures, silence may be valued as a form of respect, humility, or politeness, where individuals may choose to remain silent rather than express themselves openly. In other cases, silence may be a result of intergenerational patterns or societal conditioning, where certain topics or emotions are considered taboo or off-limits, and individuals may feel the need to suppress or hide certain aspects of themselves or their experiences.\n",
      "Understanding silence can be complex, as it requires interpreting non-verbal cues, context, and cultural nuances. Reading silence involves paying attention to body language, facial expressions, and other non-verbal cues to infer underlying emotions or thoughts. However, interpreting silence can also be subjective and may vary depending on individual perspectives and biases. \n",
      "The parts of myself that I silence aren't many, but they're significant. I silence my desires. I silence my dreams. I silence my fantasies. And I silence the opinion that if people knew these parts of me too, I'd be viewed in a totally different light than the one now. \n",
      "The dark parts of people, or the parts that others can take advantage of are the parts that are usually hidden by people in my experience. And I understand this clearly because this is something that I've been practising for a very long time now. Silence is many times the precaution that I prefer choosing over the cure. \n",
      "When you share a part of yourself with someone in conversation, you are silently inviting someone to open up to you and for people to get to know you better. \n",
      "I'm having troubles expressing my own needs & wants. Even I don't want to do something, I don't tell that to people. Or when I'm mad/sad about something or someone, I don't confront. Feelings grow inside me and I feel the weight on me. To answer the question, I would say that I'm silencing my emotions. \n",
      "i read a lot that we should sit in our feelings. The best thing a writer or any artist can do is sit in their feelings. It’s so easy to distract myself and think of things I should be doing and can be doing. But instead I should be working, dedicating time to the thing that I want to be remembered for. \n",
      "Humans crave community. They want companionship and people. I am a hugger. And a true hug, a true meaningful hug, I can’t remember the last time I received one. It’s so much easier to focus on what could bes. The community that you could have rather than focusin on the community that you have. I was wrecked by the pandemic. I see it now - in the remnants of the crystal clear broken glass. I have to rebuild myself, build myself into the person I want to be now, a year from now, 5 years from now. I feel trampled on \n",
      "I fundamentally changed the last few years and I don’t know who I am anymore or what I want anymore. It was cute when I was in high school or college. But now I just feel pathetic and lost. I don’t know who I am and I came to this conclusion too late. I was pushed into meeting hundreds of new people with whom I was this pseudo-half self and I saw my friends that I had being the self I used to be. Neither of these was who I am. Is who I am. And so it’s been so hard to not break or shatter because I’ve gone through this entire summer, the past year, with this idea of who I am and who I should be and the things I should want because that’s what people around me want. Everyone changed because of the pandemic - I know that. But how are they still while when I feel so broken? If we are a reflection of the people that we hangout with and if we are a reflection of the closest people that we surround ourselves with then who am I? Because lately I’ve been hanging out with just myself by design. And I am going a little crazy. I don’t know how to get out of that monotony. I look back at a lot of eras of my life and say “remember when I used to be friends with X ___” and hang out with Y? I don’t want to do that. I am worthy of loving. That is not the thing that is up for debate. The thing that is is my response to it. How do I respond to this and how do I move past this and how do salvage who I am? How do I figure that out? \n",

      "It can be my guilty pleasures, something that I don't want someone to know because of how they will perceive me. \n",
      "I silence the parts of myself that could be perceived as embarrassing, unlikable, or simply make me more vulnerable. I do this with everyone except for my closest loved ones. I think I hide these aspects of my personality to prevent myself from getting hurt. \n",
      "I guess I silence ideas i haven’t heard before, unsure of their consequences, their effects. Or thoughts that I feel another person wouldn’t understand. Sometimes, I don’t say things to people I’ve known for a long time because I’m afraid if they know how much I’ve changed (or not changed), they won’t like me anymore. Sometimes I don’t say something because i want to protect it without justifying it with arguments like I’m in a battle. It’s easier to say these things to a person i’ve just met (and who i likely may not meet again) because it takes some of the pressure off. We don’t know each other, we don’t owe each other, we care less about what the other person thinks of us. Recently (like this week!) I’ve discovered i can say these silencdd things to friends too, and they might understand or try to. \n",
      "Across generations, i think I just silence things that widens the generation gap, but occasionally chip away at the edge. I’m not very good at understanding through reading silence, not during conversations at least. It sticks with me though, and I keep hoping I would understand it next time. \n",
      "Fear of judgement or retaliation. I feel more comfortable talking about most things with people I've known for a while. A lot of things go unspoken around new people 1) because im naturally introverted 2) i may feel that its inappropriate to over share\n",
      "I used to silence myself and presented a version I’d like myself to be around friends. Not so much now. I normally don’t omit much between people I first meet or known for a while. My non existing filter has brought some laughs and some judgements (which I don’t think I cared after thinking about it for 5mins). I don’t like to but I silence my romantic relationship from my parents, and every time I wanted to share more I ended up remember why I silence it. I think my parent’s generation silence more than my generation. I don’t think I understand what it means for a product to read silence. If it’s figuring out things left unsaid, I think it’s better from a considerate perspective than spying on me. \n",
      "the part that I am worried due to judgment \n",
      " My silence is to the parts of myself that I don't like. I am editing the parts of me. One thing that is left unspoken is the intuitive feeling that every human being has to be happy, to love one another, and to feel good. Feel in a good state that good state feeling of when you are healthy. Feeling when your sense are responding to positive manner. It's a human experience. Any religion. Experiencing in bliss, that's silence. \n",
      "True love is silently reflects in your conversations. The feelings you feel everyday are all silent. What you feel in a relationship is what silently reflects itself onto the quality of the relationship you have with people.\n",
      "its about how to learn each others behaviors in a comfortable way because I observe strangers when I am on the subway which is noisy and stuff but as long as we are not communicating with each other I can observe them. Is that the main thing or is silence the main thing? Another thing I thought of was the James Terrell room in MoMa PS1. He dug out a hole in the ceiling, a room with a hole in the sky, they jus look at the sky and its very silent inside, people are very conscious of their voice in that space. That is another space where silence is created and there is also comfort but of course more functional space where there is silence is like a church, where its absolutely silent but you need to be silent out of respect. SO I think the question is, what is essentially the silent represent? Silence itself as a subject or silence as the nonverbal communication that they have, or the feelings that people have when they are in silent space with other people. \n",
      " both like church and James Turrell room a lot. Church is sharing a respectfulness or something and feel that other people are being accountable. James Terrell, its more like a meditation. I just generally like silence.\n",
      "Silent dialog. To me, that’s what keeps coming up, less about erasure and more about what happens in silent spaces. This unspoken or what is not verbalized, or made tangible in a silent space. Turrell and church is interesting. When I went to Turrell, we understood what was happening and being very quiet. When church, I go with other people, I am stressed about them not being quiet, I am ok being quiet, but I am worried they will not be quiet and be disrespectful. That is an interesting distinction. How do you create a space that is void of obligation but sets a tone and sets rule. The Turrell room doesn’t have rooms but does. But it also kind of does. \n",
      "With eating disorders specifically, it was a very secretive disorder. If you tell someone else about it, then you are betraying that disorder and the hold it has on your mind. It's like a leech in your mind. That's why talking about it and sharing your experience is very important. That dynamic can be mapped to mental health where people are silently suffering and we can ask why but especially when we are dealing with family trauma. A lot of my silence comes from my trauma is not as bad as someone else's trauma so it doesn't really matter. What I am going through is not as bad as someone else is going so it doesn't really matter. It's putting it on myself too. \n",
      "Breaking up silence in trauma family cycles is not something that we feel like it is our job but it is. That's when the bystander effect comes in that someone else will take care of it. What happens when everyone says that? So when you instantiate the bystander effect, silence is perpetuated and normalized but you have to take it into your hands especially in family because when you rbeak cycles, its because you're saying something and it requires you to break silence because silence is what continues the cycles. It continues on what happens when you break the silence because a lot of the times we are complacent about building after we take the first step. We've done enough when we've brought it up but I think we have to remember to keep breaking the silence because that's what normalizes the opening of the line of communication. \n",
      "I am a huge proponent of not wasting words. I have been surrounded by so many useless words that I have made it a point to be intention with the words that we use. materializing words can help, do other things. as a human organism on the planet, we need to take into consideration, the words that we use. I am a visual learner, we are not taking visual communication into being, silent films are so effective because of physical language, not just oral and written communications. words as communication then physical. my rules are to not hear what they say but watch we do. words are the container of the actions we do. When you take action we're breaking silence. silence is not passive. opening up lines of communication in family - strengthens in any dynamic, because I think that strengthens any dynamic, like clear communication. in my longest relationships, we have broken our silence and opened those lines of communications to then continue to live together. we have built a relationship that is sustainable and pleasant. that's what strengthens relationships. if you never break the silence then you are perpetuating the frustrations. thats human to human situation too you ought to seek or want to understand other perspectives. that's where your silence is active in listening and act of processing and understanding another perspective. \n",
      "I think a lot of people are suffering in silence because they are not extending themselves to others. a lot of people don't find community because they think their perspective doesn't matter. silence is the sharing of your self.\n",
      "I silence my opinions often because I'm afraid to be wrong or for others to perceive me in a negative way. I silence my honesty sometimes because I want others to view me in a positive light. I silence my opinions because that's what I was taught to do. But sometimes, I stay silent because I am comfortable. I silence myself because I want to learn more about the people around me. I am silent so I can empathize and console. \n",
      "I believe in clear communication. I never silence my feelings with people I am close to. The moment I sense some discomfort or negativity with a peer, colleagues or anyone not close enough then I try to maintain distance and go silent. \n",
      "I think people don't express enough gratitude for having each other.\n",
      "I'm guessing thats called diplomacy, fortunately or unfortunately I am unable to do that.\n",
      "I'm not sure,will ponder upon it more....\n",
      "Again, depending on the person or environment, I choose to silence the bolder (as perceived by society) thoughts of mine. I usually silence parts of me which i feel will not be understood by the other. It's also an indication of defeat if I choose silence after attempts at communicating. In my personal experience, silence has been an alternating characteristic in the sense that, someone with loud parents has gone on to become quieter and then their kids seem to be loud/extroverted yet sensitive again.\n",
      " I silence the parts of myself that make others uncomfortable. I silence what is weird, not mainstream, etc. I silence my pain and overwhelming emptions\n",
      "I use silence to hide a lot of flaws about myself from the world. I believe hide parts of ourselves in fear of social rejection but also this can minimize the joy we experience. And may prevent us from being vulnerable, and connecting with other people on a deep emotional plane. I think this generation is becoming more vocal in many ways, especially through the destigmatization of therapy and talking about our personal struggles. There are so many strange anxieties I have developed throughout my life due to this silencing of cultural “taboos”. \n",
      "I think that silence can be looked at in so many ways, both as a powerful tool and a deafening obstacle. It is defined by the context that it’s in - Silence between friends or lovers is comfortable meanwhile silence at dinner with your family is tense. In conversation, especially amongst strangers, the words we silence are topics that make people around us generally uncomfortable. As social creatures, we lean towards acceptance and that makes sense. But, amongst friends there is a known level of comfort and I think that silence still exists here - it just takes the form of silence in different topics, emotions, and you silence what you are uncomfortable saying. In the end, I guess my silence is led by how comfortable I feel in an environment. \n",
      "Different cultures and places around the world carry different views - this affects the way that silence seeps through us. We learn through what we hear, which is a product of our environment. With the emergence or social media, I think that there will be less silence where it matters and words will be heard and generational silencing around stigmatized topics will reduce. \n",
      "People try not to offend people/ are constantly reading situations and reading the \"vibe\" of the conversation to see how much of them they can reveal. I think meeting someone new I'm a lot more hyper aware of nuances in the conversation and am more filtered vs I'm more relaxed with older friends or if ive gone through some kind of defining experience w a newer friend \n"
