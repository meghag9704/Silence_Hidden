Life
So much of life has happened in the middle of the Instagram pictures  So much of life has happened that you can’t remember  Sadness and anxieity hangs heavy over the moments of happiness  The moments you wish last a lifetime are mere seconds but when you think back to them and how you felt in that moment  everything changes  you feel light again  transported back to that time when you were so happy 
I was looking at some old pictures of me — at when I was at my heaviest — my senior year of college  But really  it was the lightest I have felt in my entire life  My entire soul was uplifted  I felt like I was floating  And for the most part I did — I floated through life  I was so so so happy 
I want that unbearable lightness of being  of existing this year  I want 2021 to be that light and happy  And I will take it day by day hoping to end the day with a smile on my face and feeling light 

Yknow it wasn’t until yesterday that it hit me that you’re ignoring me or more like freezing me out  It was all the same stuff w Kaavya  no talking  broke our snap streak  no calls  nothing  And while I get that you need your space  I mean we all do  I also get that things changed while I was gone but yknow what if this is a solid friendship that shouldn’t matter but apparently it does  For my own mental health  I need to know what the fuck happened and why you’re freezing me out and that’s it  

My mind goes into overdrive and it’s an out of body experience  I am typing this and I see it but I don’t  My hands seem to be moving so fast in my head but I can’t type and the speed is painfully  crucially slow  My mind is in overdrive and flashing images run through my head  

Life
Life itself  this is who I had been for as long as I could remember  At some point  shouldn’t I try to be someone different  Shouldn’t I try to not be affected by people the same way I was when I was younger  Shouldn’t I feel more settled in who I am and where I am going  After all   I did this to myself   isolated from the group of friends  unwilling to partake and be a part of the smaller inner group  I did this to myself  Then why am I still sad  Then why am I still mad  Why do I feel this FOMO  This willingness to put up a charade  Put up all my walls and not let anyone into this fortress 

Addendum  January 22  2022  3 51pm
At some point do we need to make room for others in order to grow  How do we do that  How do you let someone else to grow and allow them to grow with you 

My brain won’t accept it but things have changed  
You have changed and my brain won’t accept it 
I have changed and my brain won’t accept it  
I look out into the mirror and see the same brown eyes 
But they are a little bit darker
A little bit shrouded
With a fire resembling fear 
And the thirst quenched with answers



I always feel guilty  My parents are well off but they have seen struggle  I grew up with privilege — with cars and drivers and extra help  I have always had a roof over my head and not a worry about where my next meal will come from  I am in all it’s sense  in the top 20   I am privileged in the way white people are — they earn for themselves  not their family  

But I feel guilty  Like I don’t have claim to it  Like I have lost touch with reality  Like I have lost the right to be sad  Like I don’t have the right to be depressed and contemplate suicide  Like privilege is the equivalent of happiness  

Because we always comment on what do they shave sad about 


This has been the longest week since being back 3 months and a week ago  Can it please please please just end already  I honestly just want it to be April 11th  I would have so much in place by then  

What I am trying to figure out is — why was I made a research assistant when people were right off the bat hired as ux researchers  Is it because I don’t have my masters and only my bachelors  Is it because I don’t have that much experience  

I could quit tomorrow and they wouldn’t think there’s a difference  This traffic has really made me go crazy  Like absolutely bonkers mad  And it’s only been 4 days  

I am glad I didn’t quit  Today was a good day  Day 5  

I have it easy   I get to sit in my AC car and come home  I have it easy  I don’t see the point of complaining because I have nothing to complain about on this front  My energy should be used more efficiently  People struggle  on two wheelers and on the backseat of autos  walking miles and kilometers to get to their destination  They spend time and money on things that come easy to me  And I waste the time that otherw crave for  I waste it on obsessing over other people and I waste it on tv  What if I gave it to my future  Don’t I already have a launching pad for success  Why don’t I use it  

Does wishing something bad happen to someone make you a bad person  What if it’s justifiable  Is it justifiable  Is ghosting a justifiable reason  


Was I mad  Was I hurt  Yes  yes I was  I thought we had a friendship that mattered but apparently it didn’t  And you turned 2 if my friends against me  Your problem is that you can’t be real w me and somehow your problem is my problem  Somehow I want to come yell at you and cry to you and ask you what the fuck I did wrong  But I love me  You didn’t give me room to breathe  You didn’t respect me and I hate myself for not seeing it sooner  People struggle with relationships and I lovers  I struggle with my friends and some are my best friends  Fake bitches ain’t nothing more  I’ll roast them but I’ll still cheer you on  Stay away from me bitch because the next time you show up in front of me  I am worried I might just kill you  

It hurts and I don’t want it to  I have come to terms with it but it still hurts  I don’t know if that makes sense  I am a great friend but she isn’t and I just want her to feel the pain  Is that too much to ask for  Does that make me a bad person  

Observation

Intermission  You decide to get the Dow gown train  Get on the Q  And you’re back on 14th 

2 45

You are on a other train 
There are 2 friends huddled around a phone 
A woman with a book 
5 people staring at phones 

Subway music  
Stand clear ping sound 
The shuffle to steady as the train lurches forward 
Train held so we’re paused 
About 15 people 
One man standing sits down and nervous or ticks 
Woman reading sets book aside and send few messages And goes back to reading 
Two friends   one napping 

Symmetry 
Waiting 

2 58pn 
You’re back at cirtlabdr  Across the way from where you started 
This time you hear the water 
Beeping in the distance 
Able meltinf and pipes leaking 
You are alone ob ‘this side of the empty platfor


You hate to admit it 
But you drink because 
You think it makes you better  

It takes about 6 drinks  
6 shots of straight up 
vodka to be precise  
A lot more beers  
But you hate beer anyway
Beer is what the fuckboys drink  

In your head  you become better  
That s when you re in your good stage 
A little fuzzy glow
Around everyone you look at  
It s almost like you re in heaven  
That s what you say 
After your sixth shot  
 Am I in heaven now   

Everything feels lighter
You feel lighter  
You feel more confident  
Is it weird to say your sass 
Comes back  
The alter ego you hide in your
Mind is unleashed  
She looks for answers  
There is a need to know more  

You nod heads 
Hug people  
Dance like you don t give a shit  
Your body moves with what you 
Think is rhythm  
You talk to more people and 
Talking to people brings you 
Back to the bar for another  

Seven  You take a seventh shot  
You feel the buzz fill 
Your body  It s warming  It s confident  
The fuckboy in front of you
Is just that but you don t care  
You nod while he talks about his frat  
Eight  You go for eight  

Eight is your limit  It s the peak  
You know it  But the boy keeps talking 
You move on to another one 
The people around seem trashier 
More drunk 
Dancing and singing 
You look for your friends  
They are too busy without you  

A wave of sadness when happy is 
Terrible  
A wave of sadness when drunk is 
Worse  
It propels you into depression  
You know that  You don t want that  
Your head says no  
Enjoy the buzz  
Keep a grip  
Your heart says Nine  
Your heart says test the waters 

Nine  Ten  Eleven  
You jump head first  
People chatter  
People sing  
People call you an alcoholic  
You were buzzed and now you aren t  
It took Eleven shots  

Your friends are the last thing 
That bother you  
The boy in front of you stops talking  
And all you want is a person  
It s a need that envelopes you  
And you hate that need  
You try to take that need off in 
The only way you know how  
Enveloping yourself in something else   
A fuckboy  

Twelve  You take a twelfth to forget  


There is something so magical seeing someone sing live  I never got why people become concert junkies  But I get it now  I watched Troye Sivan live tonight  For the first time  I was so overwhelmed I wanted to cry through every song  I took 4 videos before I was done  Because the magic of being in that moment  dancing to those songs will never return  But here is to the endless concerts  And the endless jam sessions  


I sit on rooftops and quads
Looking at the stars and city lights
I watch the blue mix with the 
Dark black trees 
I watch reflections on still water 
I am waiting 
I don t know for what or who or where
I just know I am waiting 
On this cloudless Seattle day
On the rooftops and quads 
I sit there waiting 
As the sky turns different shades of blue
I watch the planes leave their smoke
And stars illuminate the sky 
But I won t wait forever 
Because here in Seattle  
Cloudless blue skies 
Don t last too long 


I drink a little too much sometimes 
I know I shouldn t but I take another shot 
How do you stop yourself  
When it tastes so good 
And goes down so easily its your drug
And you let it inhibit you  
I do stupid things when I am drunk   


Facebook people and people people are different  
That s one of the first things you learn in college  

My need for independence scares me sometimes 

I hope to see you around 
I think about the 1am vodka shots
How easily they went down my throat 
How you needed a chaser 

Bright red solo cups 
In a dimly lit room 
More jungle juice 
More beer 
More weed 
It s everywhere 
I slip into a corner 
And watch 
People 
Because that s what I do 
I watch people 

It s 3am and I crawl into bed 


They call me plain  
They say I don t do 
Anything fun  
It hurts because 
Your alter ego wants more  

You say that through the smoke 
Coming through your nostrils
You want it to not hurt 
You get drunk 
And make terrible life choices 
And just because 
You don t laugh at stupid 
Things 
You are called not fun 

You have stuff to add 
Why do you not add to the 
Conversation thing 


There is a fine line between 
Pretend hate and actual hate  
People forget that sometimes 
People forget how fragile feelings are  
I am tired of being that person who has 
To worry  I don t want to worry anymore  

Sometimes we just need pick me ups
I am looking for mine  Because 
Alcohol can only do so much 
And then you need people  It s a deadly cycle between drugs and toxic people  

Because I have walked this road a
Thousand times before  And I am done  
I want to be done  I want this to be over  
I want this lifetime of pain to end  
It hurts and I cannot breathe  
I have walked this tightrope to many times 
One too many more than I can count 

I have never had to take a bus in Bangalore city  I have sat in an auto a handful of times  I have never walked kilometers to get to my destination  That is my privilege in India  Where I have always had someone to pick up after me  Where a driver wasn’t a novel  and sitting in a car the only way to get somewhere  Where my relationship with money was defined by my parents  Where I had to look at them for a little bit to spend instead of getting a job or the bank  Where I teetered on the edge of upper middle class and middle class to firmly settle up in the upper middle class  Where spending without thinking was just normal  Where this privilege of a car  of air conditioning  a driver  a helper  never crossed my mind  


I am so angry  Why at the lunch table do we have to bring up my driver  Why at lunch do we have to bring up my Hindi  Ever since I started working here I have realized I will get judged for things that are beyond my control  Yes I have a driver  Realistically  we are spending less on him than we would be on cab fare  My mom has help because she is literally in pain  I don’t hve to pay for him because my dad does  I fucking lived in another country and English is t

Knowing things  that s what you like the most  It s this instinct to know what s wrong with people  to have them confide in you  You say it s so you don t have to talk about yourself  You hate talking about your emotions  It makes you feel things  It hurts not knowing things  
Somewhere along the way  you lost them  You lost your confidence and you became a fly on the wall  

People make people  But what we don t realize is that people also break people  

There aren t too many instances where you can point to and be like this is where it all changed  I hope for many  those the times when the realization that everything has slotted into place hits you  Like when you were kid playing with the big blocks and you would try and try and fail again until one through tears eyes  you see a picture that makes sense in front of you

Corrected
i’ve been corrected twice today 
	1	Dirty pain in women in the tinder swindler  I guess that it isn’t dirty pain  it’s clean pain but the dirty pain they do to themselves sometimes where they’re in denial  Some are able to turn it into clean pain
	2	Seattle doesn’t have culture and america started on the east coast  History isn’t culture and it does have history  I guess it does have history l  the land is rich and there is history but there isn’t human history  no historical significant thing has happened yet or maybe it’s not talked about  If it is Native American history then let’s talk about it  let’s cherish it more  The culture there today seems very sleepy  Maybe it’s just not my culture  No museums and dinners and


It starts with a lump in your throat until it s a burning in your stomach  You cry yourself to sleep  silently yet visibly shaking  Someone else sleeps in the same room as you and they don t hear you  You know where you are going  In the few moments when the clouds part and the sun filters  you stand on the roof and let yourself breathe  You know where you are going  You haven t been there in a while  you haven t battled the dungeon in as long as you have known  You ache  And you just want to stop aching  

You try being happier  but all of a sudden people try to push you away  You feel like you aren t wanted  You feel like it s you  You need to talk to someone  

If it’s a play about people 


Starts the show talking about what do people like seeing  What’s interesting   potato chip  People more than anything  Then why not take out everything and just leave the people so you can watch people 


If it’s a okay about people then why did the shadows become more entertaining at one point  


Who we are is not in here but extends to the connections between all of us 

But people get under your skin easily  You feel like you aren t wanted  And you hate it  

Jen hates being called Jenny  Jenny is used too much and  Jen just sounds so much classier   she says  To which you respond   and older   She gives you the look  Every Time  it s the same  It s routine  And routine scares me sometimes  

The night is black and that s where my demons hide  
           

I hope to see you around 
I think about the 1am vodka shots
How easily they went down my throat 
How you needed a chaser 

Bright red solo cups 
In a dimly lit room 
More jungle juice 
More beer 
More weed 
It s everywhere 
I slip into a corner 
And watch 
People 
Because that s what I do 
I watch people 
              

Sometimes i sleep with a smile on my face  
Moon shaped smiles and stars in my eyes  
             
I watched the rain fall on the window pane  I fell in love with the noise  with the way the droplets trickled down the glass window  There was something magical about the rain  It made me smile  

I have been walking in this Seattle rain for a week  hoping for a ray of sunlight  I should be sad because that s what the weather says  I relate to the weather  I cry with the clouds and laugh twith the sun  sleep with the stars and dream with the moon  The sky has this crazy hold over me  But he past week I have been walking around in this rain  
               
Flying over the country is one of the most beautiful things  

When we took off  we rapidly approached the darkness  Running away from that light  Somewhere near the end  the light started again  Flying through a sea of clouds  all I want to do is get off right here and stand on the clouds like they do in the cartoons  Because on one side as the sun rises over the horizon  kissing the cloud line with a warm glow  the other side was a shadow of the darkness  How perfectly the two fit together  Just like the sun and moon  

The sun kissed the clouds and the clouds refused to give way  The clouds turned a beautiful pink  As the sun rose  it reflected with the blue skin and the orange glow to make a sprinkle 

Clouds seemed like the roads  I never knew what

Isn t snow just chunks of cloud falling from the sky  
               
The sand slipped through my fingers  Midway it started flowing upwards like as if a magnet was placed above us except the magnet wasn t strong enough for me  It was only the mystical pieces of sand that were attracted as they clinged to the ceiling with a magical hold  Find

Yet  grains of sand are so vast and deep  There are so many and countless  But if you look for blue pigmented sand and trap it in an hourglass  it is forever yours because deep down  the sand is your sapphire  your gem  It s your time and you can do as you wish with it  Watch the sand fall as it may taking a beautiful shape of its own due to the magnet you place under it  The shape can be your life 
               
There is something so sinfully mystical about doing things in the night  I have this place where I go to think  I found it about a week ago and I have walked there more than a dozen times at all of the oddest hours of the night  Today I needed time to think and at 12am on a cloud yet sunny Seattle day  I couldn t muster the courage to cross the road  I have j walked on the same crossings a 100 times yet this time it s different  It felt different 
Everything was sketchier and uglier  The walk there didn t give me the adrenaline boost it usually does  Maybe it was because I had skipped class for this  Maybe because I was running away from 
            


Money


here’s the thing about money  your relationship with it can irrevocably explain key facets of your identity  You can have nothing  live pay check to pay check  and still find happiness because you understand money isn’t what makes you happy  it’s people  

Secondly  there is a disproportionate amount of people that spend money on things that are not as worth  judgment seems to exist on buying more visibly material and expensive things  On eating out  The smaller payments like excessive grocery shopping and wastage of food  buying  18 books  developing  20 film  These are the type of things that don’t get looked at  Maybe because people that do these things think they have such little of it or maybe because these aren’t seen as lavish luxuries rather necessities to live  

This past weekend or a lot of the times I’ve sensed major judgment when I talk about eating out at expensive restaurants  I like food and I like the experience of it  I believe it’s something worth spending money on  Yet  it’s fleeting  not something one can own and hence seen as a corollary of an expensive lifestyle rather than a main expense in a budget lifestyle  I don’t spend money shopping or developing film or groceries  I spend it on people and spending time with people in a curated dining experience  That to me is happiness  So why can’t I be seen as a budget conscious woman as well  

There are 3 types of people 


I feel suspended in space 

We don t take the long way home 
So we can find unknown and new places 
We are so used to the same monotonous 
Routine 
And I am tired  
Tired of this  
Tired of the iron grip I have on my life 

People ask 
 How do you live with you fears   
I know what they mean  They 
Mean   How are you scared of dogs 
and heights  How are you scared 
of these things and still do it   

It s because you don t know my 
Deepest and darkest fears  
You don t know what keeps me 
Up at night  And trust me  you 
Don t want to know  I am strong  
And I can t even take it sometimes  
I dont think you want to know  

It s like when people call you 
Frantically  worried  you know
They need something from you  
Except when you told them you 
Can t help  they cut the call 
She said she thought her 
Character was a bitch in my story  
Stories are based off of real life  
Honey  I love you 
But you are a bitch

We live in a world of big brand names
We love Kendrick and Arctic Monkeys 
For they have name
And I love them as much as the other guy
As much as Chad from Sigma Apple Pie
But I also love 
My clothes from thrift stores
My coffee with unbranded cups 
And artists who sell their music on street corners


Why did you leave  
I wish friendships could have friendship surveys 
A reminder to know yes I am in this friendship 
And no I am not being burdened by you 

Why did you leave  There has to be a reason 
A reason in my because obviously there is a reason 
And it’s me because you left and before you another person left and before you someone else left 
It has to be me because I am the only common denominator 
And trust me I have tried to take me out of the equation one too many times 


I fall in love with people a little too easily 
Far easier than I fall out of love with them 
Because I don’t think I ever do fall out of love with them 
I bare my soul for them 
Even when they threaten to rip it out of my heart 
I am over it 

  
I hate money  I hate everything it brings with it  I hate the talk  I hate the assumptions  I guess sometimes assumptions are necessary  I guess it’s needed sometimes to profile people  

This job was doing well for me  it has taught me a lot  Being back home has been good for me  But the past week  I can feel it turning toxic  Both  work  and the city  I love being home  but I am getting too comfortable  I don’t have a life and I am finally missing my friends  It’s tough without social interaction  especially when your social media feeds are filled with them  I miss them but I am too lazy to text them and follow up  As for this job  don’t even get me started  I am so tired of being profiled as a “rich” and “priveleged” kid  Rather than meeting people and rather than learning  I see it becoming an obstacle  I see it become  a problem  I see it become a wedge  I am tired of the traffic  I am tired of the non communication  and in all honesty  I am tired of sitting on the bench  I am tired of the assumptions and I feel incapable to break through the assumptions  I feel incapable to make a change  I feel incapable to get my voice heard  I feel stifled  

This is a question I’ve had for years — am I an exception  Like am I pampered too much  I know people who have lived lives far more privileged than mine  do they hide it  Do they feel ashaamed  Am I doing something wrong that makes me standout more than I should  Should I act in a different way or talk in a different way  And what about them  who are more privileged  Do they just not interact with people or are put in situations that make them reflect on their privilege  How do they own it  How  

I don’t know whether it’s the impending admissions results or the fact that I’ve been back 4 months now  almost 5  or the fact that some things about work are just giving me a lot of anxiety  but I am just questioning everything and I don’t feel ok  I don’t feel the best  I have a pit in my stomach since yesterday  I am taken back to 4 years ago  I feel lonely  I have very bad thoughts  and I am depresssed  There really is no other word for it but I feel despair and I am depressed in the dictionary definiton of these terms  Despair  Depressed  and Desperate  

I am itching for change  I think Krishna makes the world go in mysterious ways  I am not sad about coming home  Hell  it was the best thing to happen to me  Something I was craving  I need to put it to good use and actually send in pieces for publication  And so  I believe whatever will happen next will be for the best and to teach me something  To help me grow in some way  I am just desperate to know what it is  

I actually miss academia though  Working has taught me that I miss academia and I know what to do this time around  I miss academic research  

I love a little too easily  
I remember growing up with my mum  She would tell me   Darling  love a little less   

notes on fluency 
the ability to hold conversation with skilled dexterity over a breadth of vocabulary  the feeling of calling  owning  and commanding over a language  often one that is “native”  defined as origin  history  generational  to a person  it is about autonomy and ownership over words and thoughts  inculcating inclusivity and assimilation within a person   often fluency is accompanied by lack of recall causing the person to rely on extensive description to relay the message  it’s the approach of learning to string the right words in the correct order to form a description that elicits the word from the native speaker  

I am so tired  
Tired of everyone 
And everything  
Last night was fun  
With them  
I don t have anxiety  
It s because I don t have expectations  
They are just easier to be around  
And I am done carving out paths 
For other people to trample on  
I am my own person  

We used to be best friends  
What happened to that  
I barely see you  
We co exist 
We barely talk  
This is what you want  
This is on you  
You should know that  
I tried talking  
You shot me down  
Enjoy with your other friends  
Because you are just a person to me now  
I am done  

7 40pm  walking thoughts
There is something so introspective about putting in your earphones and walking around  thinking about what’s happening and how you’re feeling  You feel like such a main character in the middle of a major life crisis 
And well  I feel like that  I feel alone and empty and scared  So  Scared  I haven’t had to need a lot of things in my life  New York  definitely a want  But I have always needed people  I have always needed to not feel so alone  I have always needed to be needed  And somehow I get a lot of things but I don’t get that  What do I hve to do to get those things  To feel safe in trusting people  To be happy within myself 
I am happy with myself I promise I am 
Everything said and done  this year gave me one very vital thing  it gave me the time to be me  for me to understand who I am and what I want from life  It gave me the time to love myself like I’ve never loved myself  My job  regardless of everything I say about it  it saved me  It gave me purpose and forced me to live  It gave me value and I am definitely sad to leave  I wasn’t in a good place a year ago  I remember laying on the floor of my bathroom a little over a year ago wishing to milk myself  I am not going to lie  I have thought about that a lot but my job  my family  and my friends from overseas kept me alive 
I am ready to jump into this next chapter of my life  I am scared but I am ready  I have nothing holding me down here  Nothing holding me back  Nothing keeping me back  I can do and be what I want 
I feel very aimless like I don’t know what to do with my weekends  Is that how workaholics become  My workaholic self is motivated by loneliness 
I need people to like me and I fight it but it’s difficult 
I am scared of finding and meeting people to live with in New York  How do I do it 


Lake

Have you ever been to a lake  I could just sit by a lake with birds and ducks and duck watch for hours 

I do wish it everyday  I hate people who lie to me and who aren t straight with me  
I do want them to be unhappy  Is it terrible of me to wish that they s

Lately   dinners 
Lately I’ve been doing dinners  I am a brunch girl through and through  Breakfast for dinner has been my favorite meal since I was a child  As I grew I woke up too late and didn’t have time for breakfasts and so a breakfast for lunch or dinner seemed like the best way to get my breakfast food kick   waffles  pancakes  brioche  EGGS  Brunch   well brunch is my favorite meal  Add some day drinking where it’s completely respectable and acceptable to pass out at 9pm   I am here for it  But lately I’ve been having some great dinner meals  

It’s been about the conversations  the intimacy  the less flare but more sophisticated approach to it all  


Lately peripheral friendships

There are so many people in your life you’re friends with because of circumstance  Is that why you make friends  

How do I know we’re out of the pandemic  

Well my depression came back  Full for r and that weird anti social funk where I hate everything even tho if h my life is pretty great  That fucjing existential dread  

This morning 

I had a hallucination ……   about killing myself  I thought about how easy it would be to go to the kitchen and pick up a knife and slit my wrist  How I won’t have to deal with any of this anymore  No one will find me for a few days and then probably my parents will find out that I am not replying to calls and set out a hunt for me  Probably call kaavya or bhaiya and then Erica will probably find me  

I never planned to live this long  I never planned to actually graduating college  to actually living an adult life  And that’s why I struggle with this so much  I don’t know how to be an adult because I never wanted to be one  I never thought I would get here  

So k went tkt be fun 

I know when things are going south  And this is it  This is it  I am sinking  That point that always happens it s come  I am out  

I am done  I m not that important to any of them

I have been through this a thousand times before  I know what this means  And I am done  done being treated like this  This is how I have felt for a long  long time  I am crying on the inside  I am done  

April 9th 2016  3 55 AM
There is something I just realized  This world I am living in is mine  That s a thought that goes through my mind everyday  I remind myself that everyday but right now it was one of those rare 4 am musings  This life I am living is mine  and mine alone  I can sit here and laugh over videos or I can go out there and make some experiences  I don t need to rely on people to make my experiences  I need myself  And sometimes  that s going to be enough  Sometimes I am going to have an ache in my chest which is going to scream how I need people  But other times  I am going to remind myself I am enough  I need to remind myself that because there is so much I want from this world  so many experiences that no one else but I can push for  

happiness comes in short bursts
and i take as much of it as i can get   

the pit of my stomach is hollow 
and my heart clenches 

i have been down this road one too many times
and i have picked myself up 

if i fall again
will i stand up again  

I hate to say this  but 
But your actions hurt me  
They affect me more than they should  
I try to not let them  
Because after all  
You are only my friend  
Another person in the sea  
You treat me like a bystander  
A placeholder  
And I take it  Because on those days 
The ones we laugh and watch movies  
I am happier  But this  
This is toxic  
I have enough people to 
Bring me down  
I have an army that I call family  
As they bulldoze me with bullets  
I call it quits on the friendships that do so too 
I need to start cutting ties  
And I need to start doing it from you  
The people who make me anxious   

You call me passive 
But honey  you are the most unoriginal person
I have ever met  I would never tell you this 
Because I have a heart  But  you are a clone of 
The people you hang out with  I see you change  
Change with every person you meet 
It’s a great thing  
But when I see the people  
When I hang out with them  I see who they are  
And I see who you are 
Nobody changes that fast  
Because then  
What do you believe in  
What do you stand for  
I thought you didn’t tell me because 
You didn’t want to talk about it  
But now I realize  it’s because
You don’t know   
You can’t call me passive 
Because darling  
You don’t know me  
You never asked if I was okay  
Or if I had a bad day when I clearly did  
You made small talk  
And I hate small talk  

You said I didn’t believe in the right things 
When you talked about kids in the future 
And I said I don’t want kids  
You told me I would change my mind  
Stop telling me what to do 
And how you and that boy you met 20 minutes ago 
Are now a “thing” 
I laughed internally  
Internally because I am a great friend  
I am there for you  
A shoulder for you to cry on  
But you haven’t seen me cry  
You look at your phone when I try  
Try to tell you about my shitty day  
You treat me like a blank page  
When I am color  
I don’t believe in the things you
Believe in  But I believe in the clouds
parting for the sun  
Even if it’s for a couple of minutes 
Amidst this Seattle rain  
I believe in wishing on stars  and 
Knocking on wood  
I believe in the power of words  
And kindness  
I believe that one day I can make a difference 
I believe in the little things  
And I would run  faster than light if I could  
Towards it  

You said I wasn’t smart  
Sure  I laugh at myself  
But that’s because I am a good sport about things  
You don’t have the right to shit on me 
Especially not for being me  
I have dealt with people like you all my life  
But look at me  I am still standing  
And I intend on being this strong  
Or actually much stronger at the end  
Don’t laugh at me or call me dumb  
Because I have better grades than you right now  
Because I give a shit about things other than “practicality”
Because I have been through things 
You have no idea about  
You’re right  
I am not the smartest person out there  
But you don’t have a right to tell me 
I have no ambition 
Because you aren’t my mother  
Because I am not scared to look  
To crave the wilder things  
Don’t laugh at me  
Because it makes you sound like a hater  

I have spent a lot of time on you  
And on the things you have said  
I have tried to win approval but what I realize  
Is that I am not important to you  
You are an important part of me 
You have been a part of my life
For far too long  
But I am tired of being 
A paper clip to paper people  
You make it a competition  
I never entered  
And if you thought I did  
This is me saying  
“I am out ” 
Because I don’t shy away from 
Telling people I can’t manage anymore  
I don’t give up on people  
But I am learning how to  
Starting with you  
Because I am done with this toxicity  

Stick  stuck  sticking  
I hate the variations  

Sticks  like the twigs I threw at you  
The ones you held in the flat of your palm 
Grazing your fingers along the rough edges  
Twigs  you crushed them one by one  
Leaving ashes in a cloudy smoke around your face  
With laughter ringing in the forests  
You made me laugh  
Through my sadness and pain  
You made me want to stick  
Stick to you as we rushed past throngs of people  
You made me want to be stuck  
Next to you  but I was scared  

Stuck  that’s how I’ve always felt  
That’s what I am scared of  
You make it seem so easy  
But in truth  
Pearls are stuck in oysters  till oysters break  
I want more than the oyster  I want the sea  
Pearls  
I think of the way they lined my mum’s neck
When she was with my father  
I think of the way she used to twirl them
When she was happy  
But my father left  and with him he took the pearls  
He broke the oyster  
I always resented him for it  
Even if I am turning into him  
He was worried about sticking  
Being stuck with us when there was so much more  
I wish I could say leaving is easy  
But I know the pain he went through  
I felt it as I walked away from you  

Sticking  I wish the car stuck that day  
The way chocolate fondue sticks to my strawberry 
Only if the tyres didn’t skid on the grease  
Only if my brother’s car hadn’t crashed into the woods  
Only if trees dropped sticks when cars ran into them 
Instead  my brother was crushed under the weight of the fallen trees 
He didn’t stick  
He left more easily than my father  
It was the last thread  
I watched my mother change every night 
I watched my mother grow frailer by the day 
I watched her until she wasn’t here 
She never wanted to be here 
She never wanted this life for me 
She never wanted me to be stuck like she was 
But she left  
Left me to be stuck here alone  

I am scared of the woods 
I am scared of the sticks I throw at you 
I am scared of being stuck in this world 
I am scared of being stuck in my mind 
But I keep coming back to it 
I keep throwing sticks at you 
I keep eating fondue
And I keep driving through the woods 
But I fell 
Fell down the rabbit hole
And I couldn’t do it any longer  
Alice didn’t find her wonderland so how could I 

Instead  I took solace in you 
You were the reason I stayed for however long I did  
Because throwing sticks at you almost made everything okay 
Watching the sticks bounce off your arm meant I would one day leave 
But with every day  
You made me want to leave less  
But I had to go  
So I just wanted you to pour the morphine down my throat
So I didn’t have to live anymore 
So I didn’t have to be stuck anymore 
I thought you wouldn’t mind 
Because you broke me long ago—
Crushed me with your strength
Just like the trees did to my brother
And you did to the sticks I threw at you 

I remember playing on playgrounds as a child 
Playing with the coarse yellow sand 
The swings and the red slides 
I remember running around in my yellow dress—
The one my mum insisted I wear  
The one I hated with a burning passion  
The one everyone complimented—
Saying I looked effortless and fun  
I thought that was happiness  
The feather light  carelessness of it all  

And slowly  leaves fell from trees 
Only to be replaced by new ones  
And I watched them fall around my favourite park 
Watching the temporality of yellow leaves
On a fall day  
Year after year  I came back on the same day
To watch the same tree change color—
Even through the humdrum of life  
I made my favourite childhood park my safe haven—
From the baggage I accumulated on the other 364 days  

The brightness of a warm and yellow sun  
had been replaced by the dark grey clouds 
I’d take more time to plan my outfits  
Think about the comments before posting a picture  
And how I’d be perceived  
On the other 364 days of the year  
I’m more caught up with the glow of my screen  
Than the yellow coarse sand I’d grown up playing with 

I was seventeen  
And I had had one too many shots of something I can’t even remember  
While I was trying to drown my pseudo misery  
My drunken state brought me back to that memory  
Of the carelessness  the feather light feeling  
I looked around the room  
The people I craved had a fuzzy yellow glow around them 
Like they knew something I didn’t  And so  I asked someone—
It was the night I found out about Van Gogh  

Van Gogh ate yellow paint
Because yellow is the color of happiness 
And even though he knew it would kill him  
Van Gogh thought 
The paint would make him happy on the inside  

Through fragments of careless  childhood memories  
I remember thinking if life was that easy—
And we  humans  had just made life a little bit of a chore
With the pressures of what is socially acceptable or not  
And so  the next morning  
Nursing a raging hangover induced headache 
I painted my room yellow  
So that the sun was always in my room 

Van Gogh ate yellow paint so he could be happy  
So that he could create art that would be appreciated and loved 
Van Gogh ate yellow paint so he could be accepted for who he was  
I eat mine by being the paper clip to the paper people  
By sitting around  in the dark  listening to the heartbeats 
By the constant urge to need people  
By being calm  like the blue empty skies  
When I feel like a thunderstorm is coming  
Just so I could be accepted for my feather light carelessness  

Yellow paint became my personal sign of happiness  
Almost as if the Van Gogh story was a metaphor to my life 
And as I replaced my dress for yellow rain boots  
I felt lighter because the things I attached to 
My symbol kept me grounded in reality—
Even if I knew  the happiness they brought me
Were like the temporary yellow fall leaves  

There is something magical in the way light enters a room   like a sharp spotlight  Almost as if you could see the air particles dancing in the sunlight  as you watch the long shadows move across the canvas  There is something magical about the long lean 

You were my best friend and you left 
One day out of the blue you stopped replying to my texts 
I told myself it was in my head 
But it wasn’t was it  
I have always believed in self love and surrounding yourself with positivity 
I try to be the sunshine on rainy Seattle days so that you would still want me to be around 
But you don’t  
You turned your back on me when I needed you the most but you still have this hold over me 
I still text you even though I know you won’t see them 
Even though I know you won’t reply 
I text you because i think about our inside jokes and I think about the times that have passed and I think about the times we stayed awake together 
And I hope that that will remind you 
That that will make you miss me 

You were my best friend and you left 
And I fucking hate you for that 
But I will always love you even when you don’t love me
But I will be there when you need me 
And you will always have a sunshine in me

There is apparently a certain novelty to being single in college—especially Spring quarter  Its almost as if  all the couples have come out of hiding because you see more of them on the quad  on Red Square  You see them holding hands and a clear sign of PDA  For other people its like being single is the greatest thing they have thought of  For those who have been in a relationship  even if its on and off  since fall quarter  they are tired of the seasonal changes and want to embrace the independence  Then there is the people who are sex crazed and don’t want to be tied down  I am not sure how many people make up my category but I am single  barely been kissed  girl who just wants a relationship  Who just wants a person to need them and keep them company  I am not asking for much  but apparently its so hard to be loved that I have given up 

Relationships were never my priority in high school  That was something I would do in college  I had this idea of college—lots of boys  lots of alcohol and lots of fun  Honestly  college has been fun but it just seems like high school 2 0  Except this time  I actually want a relationship  I know there are 5 months of the quarter left and then 4 long months of vacations  What’s worse when one of your best friends has a line of boys almost as if the universe tells the boys she knows that she is currently single or going to be very soon  And even before she s done with one  sh has another primed and ready to parade in  She doesn’t need the boys  but sh has them as a back up for when she does  And then there is this other friend who has never been a person who talks boy  But she fell in love with her best friend almost as if her life is a cliche  

Apparently I am asking for too much when I say all I want is a boy to love me  

There is a certain glow on the horizon  a light pinkish hue as it mixes with the yellow accents  The color dips into a blue  like the vast blue dark skies  How is the sky blue when the sun is orange 

I keep thinking about what my life should be like  That’s a thought that crosses my head way too many times  If I have to think about who my best friend in college is my mind goes to the person I opened up to but they dropped me  It hurts because I don’t have a best friend anymore  And I think about how long it took me to open up and how I might ever open up again and I am baffled  The funny thing is I keep looking at how my life should be that I forget to look at how my life is now  I am loved and cherished and people care about me  It’s more than I could have ever asked and it makes my heart so full  I forget to love myself because I am too busy loving others  I am too busy waiting for their approval but really I’m the one who got me here  Yet somehow I keep questioning my worth and my strength  I brought myself here from those dark days  I stand here  not thinking about auicide or how a knife would feel on my wrist because really it took a long time to come here  But I am here and I forget to cherish that  

That s the thing society tells you to need people  And that s what makes me hate it  I have been on my own for so long I forget to remind myself that I made it this long  

It s human nature to compete  we were born to survive  It started with the monkeys and we pushed to look better  walk straighter  We evolved and became human  

I feel sad  I am sitting here before my exam and I feel sad  I know life is about living on your own but for some reason I feel like I need someone to call me and ask me how I am doing  To remind me I am enough and that I am a vital part of their life  I guess all I want is to be wanted  

just a little bit of poems and prose   you could also call them epiphanies  
 everything here is original work unless explicitly stated otherwise

 1   poetry in motion 

I wrote this after a certain blowout with people and a day full of missed buses and trains   poetry  poet 

Everyday this past week I haven t gotten to bed before the sun rose  I have watched the first few days of sun hit the ground  I have watched the deep ink blue skies turn cerulean  I have watched the quiet streets of 4am turn into the scurrying and honking mess of 8am  I have watched the night wane as the moon comes into full view and disappears with the brightness of day  

It s not just that I am nocturnal  I have raged against the dying of the light  

This past week has been horrible around the world  From the shooting in Orlando to the mass execution in Cameroon to the shootings in Syria and Iraq  There is so much violence in the world   terrorism happens everyday  It s been a tough week  actually a tough year for humans or maybe a tough few years with no end in sight  How long will terrorism go on  How long will humans keep repeating the same mistakes  All we can do is hope that it changes one day  there is a little more peace in the world  
Ps  for your sanity  don t google  list of terrorist incidents this year  

we talked about shoulders—
how the perfect girl felt unconscious 
how the internet had never seen this much skin because of consciousness
because our society told girls to hide our shoulders
because bare shoulders were a sign of sexuality— 
but baby come kiss me because fuck society 

When i started college as an international student 4 years ago  college to me was the place where we found our passions  But no one tells you that going to a public school meant applying to your major  I hated science with a passion until I came to the UW and found Home at the iSchool  My love for technology and writing came together in a beautiful way that is human computer interaction and at the core of it was my most important passion—humanity  Through these 4 years I have fallen one too many times but after every time I had stood back up taller than ever  Today I am terrified of what the future holds but I am also so so excited to see everything that is coming my way  

To say that the past 4 years have been a constant state of anxiety and unrest would be an understatement because sometimes it was much worse  It was also the best time of my life and if I had to do it again  I probably would  And look at me with my 2 tassels on my cap  


I lay myself out like a doormat expecting people to treat me the way I treat them  It’s absolutely horrible but what do I keep expecting  

Ready for some loud music 
Lets converse like this 

I am so embarrassed I am hiding my face
Tell me when this all is over 

If I am at this level no one can see me 

Don t worry I will sit properly as I don t want u to suffer alone 

Last thing  if we sit in the car and eat then he will play loud music and pretty much every one can here it 

Death
Seems so appealing  Everything seems better when you’re dead  You’re remembered for the good  Hell even serial killers are remembered and pulled apart for a trace of goodness 
But being alive is so difficult  Why should you live  To cause more pain  To cause small pain everyday  Why not just take the deep dive and just cause one big pain  It’ll heal 

Someone once told me I had this idea of me but I never worked towards it  It stung because deep down she was right  I sit afar and re think my actions  make myself a version of the story which would be better  Which would align to the person I want to be  Yet when I am out in a situation  I run away from discomfort and vulnerability  

By the water and in the forests  as we went whizzing down a windy road  after 8 miles of hikes and 24 hours of memories in hand  I felt a sense of calmness  We all lived in the same moment  listening to the Good Vibes Spotify playlist  our hearts beat separately but our minds were one  Cutoff from the world  but knowing we returned to it refreshed  For once it wasn’t a moment where I didn’t want to end  instead  I knew if it ended it just brought with it the immense possibility of a similar future adventure  That excitement pushed me forward  

So untouched we say looking at the Pacific Northwest Beauty  Off roading And well trodden trails  we see stumps fallen over and moss grown on them  And then we encounter the stumps that are too flat and the only reason for them was so you could walk there  But there they stand as broken reminders that you are entering their land — some sad and thin leaning over other thicker stumps  trees with rings you can’t count because you’re too stupid for that  They are a reminder  some sad some rude awakenings that they were here first and they will be here after you  that you will move onto see it’s cousins and to bid them farewell  that you are a visitor in the land where they stood proud and tall  where they lay their seed and will give birth to future trees  

The clouds skirted above the water  wafting into the trees and 

Do you ever just get so in your head about your friends and the people that are here and the people that have left  the jobs you have to do and the jobs you don’t have it  the sheer intensity of nature and walking around like a mad person through the thick forest  I had one of those today  0 25 miles into a hike  I felt like I couldn’t breathe  my heart constricted  and I felt like I was going to die  and then I started thinking about how it’s the end of July  and I don’t really have a job and I don’t know what I am doing honestly  This week has been such a shitshow with me barely working on anything and it was bad  

Moments that put a smile on our face
Life can get so noisy sometimes   the deadlines  the onslaught of meetings  Scheduling meetups and staying in touch  Sometimes  regardless of how great things are going  it gets messy and loud  But in between all of that we get caught up in our monotony  we forget to find color  we forget to smile with our hearts 
This past year taught me about trusting myself 
Recently  I go to bed thinking of one picture  of one moment that put a smile on my face   may that have been a conversation with a barista who s name I never bothered to know  a silly afternoon sitting in an overpriced cafe  waking up on a flight in the midst of a beautiful sunrise  sitting by the ocean watching a mesmirizing sunset  Or most of all  times with my friends  Thinking back I am washed over with a wave of calmness  I am transported to the place I was in  to the way it felt  tasted  sounded  smelt  I can hear the waves crashing  the laughter of people  the blaring music  I can taste the burnt coffee  I can feel the unconscious smile that has resided over my face 
And I feel complete  I feel invincible  And I feel thankful  Thankful for the happiness in the world  happiness in my life  It makes me yearn for more moments like those  And I want to be more present  more aware of those moments  I want to take the time to savour those moments in the future  Because they come and go too fast  And then you re left again in a dark room  typing on your laptop years later 
Thinking back to those moments gives me a sense of calm  I know I can never go back and I know I can never recreate that moment  I know I am looking at some of them with rose tinted glasses  zooming into that one fleeting minute of pure ecstasy  But sometimes  playing and replaying that on loop gets you through life  I feel like that s what I have been doing 
I often feel like such a failure  I feel so sad  I feel defeated  But its these moments  these airy breezy happiness filled moments that lift my spirits 
I hope to make more of these this year 

I press my hand on my thighs and there it is  the bulging masses  the ones that make others stare  
Or not stare  The ones that attract the snide comments and the ones that I have grown to hate  

Sometimes I read something so fantastical that I buy into it  But then I am cruelly reminded of the shit times  If the gods we say existed  why did colonialization happen  Why were south asians

But speaking of  I have been considering something and I need a perspective and who better than you honestly  I talked to maa about it but I haven’t really talked to papa in depth plus he isn’t really the type to talk things out  but I was wondering if I could get some advice from you — my friend is moving to New York and she asked if I wanted to move with her and I kinda wanna do it  
I know big mood and woah but  Here’s the situation  I don’t have a job in Seattle  I don’t have a job in New York  Cost of living will be more in New York  I am aware but I can make it work  New York does have a high supply as compared to demand of jobs which may be a problem  but Seattle hasn’t proven any better  Either way  I’ll have to leave the country in October if I don’t find a job anyway  so really what’s stopping me  

What’s really stopping me  I love Seattle and my friends and my life but as far as job market goes New York has everything And I know that the supply is so much more in New York and that’s going to be tough but honestly for tech stuff Seattle is no easy place either  But either way putting all of that apart  and considering that cost of living will be more expensive in nyc than Seattle  is it stupid to just uproot your life and move to this place that I have wanted to live in for so long  I don’t know if that makes sense but I just think I need a new adventure and nyc def is one  I have been talking to people and while they agree some have said taking a few years and working on saving up and then transferring Might be good  might be safer but what if

	•	I used to be so unafraid  As I watched the water crash on the ocean   watching a wave form and crash  gather itself before it collapses is such a simple beauty
	•	Used to be unafraid in the water and now all I can think about is standing too far in  being consumed by the water

I see the tears in my dad’s eyes  The pace of our housekeeper slow down  I’ve written about trauma and pain for years but I never knew where it came from  It came from years of watching my dad getting angry  My dad get stabbed in the back from close friends and worst of all his family  From my dad letting my mom down  From my mom’s expectations of me  From my mom’s quietness  From my mom’s self doubt 
I grew up like that  Hour after hour  fight after fight  being called worthless and useless by the hour  I don’t know how much of a trauma it left on my mum but i see it in her eyes 
God  I miss being a child  Miss being able to forget about it and live in my own dreamland 
Being away and home now after years is different  I get to see the permanent scars left on my mom’s psyche  the hurt in her eyes  the self hate  I see pain my dad’s hiding  the anger he harbors at himself  lashing out in different ways  The expectations he carries and the big dreams and hopes 
My parents are dreamers so of course I am one too  A dreamer expected to not cry  A dreamer expected to hold it together  To be put together 

It was a story of the people The people that set at tables with no conversation The people who ate in silence and spoke different languages The people who worked on their laptop in a place that was too fancy for work The people who laughed while they ate  food being an after thought The people who sat across from each other with nothing to say   The people who sat next to each other with nothing to say  That lonely girl with her laptop and a coffee  Me with my food  people watching That table with the loud noises who couldn’t stop talking  The cheerful laughter of people floating across the room

First  I want to apologize to my friends int he room  the people in this room that know me in some capacity or form  I am sorry for the times I have seemed cold and disinterested  I am sorry for being overeager  I am sorry if I was ever toxic to you  I am sorry for pushing my sadness onto you  But most of all  I am sorry for the times when I wasn’t honest with you 
You see  I don’t understand myself sometimes  I have lied to myself and sometimes I need to make up stories in my head to just get out of bed and get going  I don’t know what to say to you because I am too in my head  I am looking for a thought  In those quiet times  when you’ve felt like there is nothing to talk about  I am sorry for being disengaged because my brain won’t shut up  Its not making any sense really  its just empty  hollow and a voice echoes in that emptiness — a voice telling me i am not enough  I am not worthy 
If you ask me to tell you about the last time I was happy  I can pull up a memory from last weekend when I saw my friends at a bar and we drank  But I went home that night and cried my eyes out  I don’t know why I was crying and I’d be lying if I said that was the first time that week when I had cried myself to sleep  For the past 2 years  that has been far too much of a common occurrence 
People constantly ask how I am doing  I smile  say I’m good  and genuinely have nothing else to say  I smile but i don’t feel the smile  Do you know what I mean by that  a smile that extends and you can feel it in your heart 
So we were just on spring break and I went to Puerto Vallarta with my best friend  then a Californian road trip with my high school best friend  and then visited my other best friend in San Diego  It sounds perfect  I cam back home that saturday evening  made myself dinner  got into bed  and cried  I didn’t feel anything  i felt hollow but I knew I was crying because of the wet tears rolling down my face  There was a nagging voice in my head — go to that damn party  go see people  you’re running out of time  But all I could do was lay there  unable to move  and the dark thoughts just kept coming 
Have you ever picked up a knife to cut an apple but thought how it would feel on your skin instead  Have you ever thought what would happen if you just put it right through you  Stabbed your stomach  Would it pain  Would I bleed out in seconds  I am not afraid of death  I am afraid of living  I am afraid of putting myself up here and talking about this and I am afraid of what will happen when I wake up tomorrow  I am afraid of the pitiness and the tears and the smiles  People ask me why I don’t put myself out there more  Why I like to play it safe and just do what I am doing  Its so that I can stay a little sane  Going about what may be a normal day for you is extraordinary for me sometimes 
My friends really are the best  Some I have met in the last 6 months thanks to the wonderful house I am living in  and some I have known since my first day here  I have lost some and I have gained some invaluable ones  But anyone that I dare to call my best friend has helped me get here today  I never talk about this  I really don’t know how too  I don’t know how to pick up a phone and say ‘I feel like killing myself  can you come over please ’ But I know I can and I promise that is enough for me  I am sorry if I am not vulnerable enough but please know each and every one of you matter so much to me and I love you all  I don’t say that lightly  ‘love ’ I truly do mean it  I wouldn’t be here without the glimpses of happiness you all bring to my life 

Grandparent visit musings
	•	Is the inflation of 125x the reason why Dadi has lost vision of what is enough  No idea or in touch with the reality  Things compounded so much   is it the idea that we had loss 
	•	What am I meant to answer when she asks “how much is enough to be satisfied ” What am I meant to answer when all I want to do is say you’re going to live another 20 years at the most   this is not going to matter anymore after that 
	•	The earliest memory my dadu has is from 1940 at the age of 3  Imagine if someone chronicled his life   what would it be  Everyone should journal 
	•	I think we can all choose to be happy at some point after we’ve recognized  after we’ve put in the work to be better  And I will  I hope to be more positive and content going forward  I choose to be happy and think about what is going well in the world  Because too much goes wrong 

love is the smell of freshly brewed coffee
airplanes and the excitement of new adventures

You know what I have realized with social media  It s all consuming  it s the best reason to avoid thinking  

baby tell me all about you Quickly We’re not getting any younger and I don’t want to waste any time in falling in love with you

It’s my funny life 
I can feel so happy and fulfilled one day but there is nagging feeling that this isn’t happiness  That this isn’t life  It’s an illusion of it  And then the next day the cracks begin to appear  What do you do with those moments  Cherish them  Hold them close to you so you can look back at them in nostalgia  Or look through rose tinted glasses to scrutinize the facade created 
It’s a funny life 
How my dad  injured by his own wounds  reacts the way he does  The way his temper shoots off the roof and ricochets around him  The way his eyes fight off the hurt he is feeling as he tries to stand up for himself  How much has he been through  I get it  I do  I want to hold him tight and tell him we’re not fighting with him  That we’ll stand by him no matter what  But he makes it so difficult to love him  He makes it so difficult to watch my mom shrivel up 
It’s a funny life 
Watching my mom be strong and laughing one day  And then watch her become a shell of a human the next  To know that for days to come she will hurt herself by telling herself things that aren’t true — fallacies of self hate  To know that for the next few days she will know when I carefully watch her but won’t be able to look me straight in the eye  To have her come to me and apologize 
It’s a funny life 
How I tried to run away from this  To not live this and think this for years  And then only to be jolted back in it 
Why do I sympathize with people that hurt me  Is it because my mom taught me that  To tolerate my father even after he hurts her  hurts me  Is it because we re taught tolerance is what holds a family together 

Family
How is it that humans have evolved with the one aim of procreating  Were kids the accident nobody signed up for  I remember the day my mom told me I was an accident  A happy accident but an accident nevertheless 
Family yells  backstabs  betrays  I ve seen through it all  And when I think I havent seen something  I see it  Its quite astounding how family is the one gift that keeps on giving 
But being a parent — how is that something that people actually want to be  I remember the day my mom told me I was an accident  I also remember the day she told me that I was the best thing to happen to her  well one of them  and when I did happen  I gave her immense peace and joy 
Our family makes us  Literally makes us — our scars  bones  the way we view the world  And yet  in today s world  you can t talk about them   Everyone has family daddy mommy issues   Everyone has a crazy aunt or uncle   Everyone has cousins that they love and cousins that they hate   Everyone has grandparents with unrealistic expectations 
Well ok  Everyone does  But how come not everyone has the scars I do  If everyone has it  how does it affect me so much more than the other person 
I am so tired of keeping this family together  Holding it together with sweat and tears that I have forgotten how to hold myself together 
This isn t how life is supposed to be  is it  If it is  then why do we continue to be pro life and bring more people into this disaster  Why do we keep fighting 

I deal with self diagnosed social anxiety  I say self diagnosed because I have never actually seen a doctor for it  
But what do you call being rooted to the ground in public  what do you call being unable to say something in public  of being scared of being judged  of not being able to move infront of people  Its anxiety and especially under social scenarios  

I know 3 languages  and I am learning a fourth  I understand an additional 2 more  At my internship people spoke in hindi and while i understand fluent hindi  I speak hindi at home  I can’t speak it in social situations  I understand that we should push ourselves to do things we aren’t comfortable with  But language is what you can use to portray your confidence  It is the tool to fool everyone around you  And no matter what  every time I have to speak in hindi in public  I can feel the bile rising in my throat  And so  I don’t  I listen to people in Hindi  let them assume I am an entitled prick  and yet reply in cool collected english without stumbling or feeling anxious  Because language helps me identify with my thoughts  it gives me the power I know I have  But it doesn’t make me any less Indian 

It goes well until it doesn t  

I want someone to look at me the way random people look at you  
The brightness in their face when they are graced with your presence   
That happiness  I want it  

I don t want you  I want your personality  
I want the carefree poise you pretend to have  
I want to be the reason for someone to smile  

Running away from responsibilities 
Is a term that is thrown around way too often  

But that is my very basic instinct  
Give me a stressful day and you ll see me running away from the skyline  
Weekends I get I prefer making trips  
I run away from everything that makes young basic life   

sitting in a dark room at 2 42 in the morning  some things are very clear to me  
1  I run away from situations far too easily
2  I need people’s approval when deep down I know I am the only person who is going to be living this life
3  I need to do something about the life I want otherwise what happened with colleges is going to happen to me  


we spend years hiding 
our bodies in clothes  
our thoughts in candy dipped words


I knew it was getting colder but i was in denial and then i saw the mountain that looms over us and i could see the fresh snow it had accumulated over the days it hid from us and there was no denying anymore as it stood tall and proud yet shyly peeking through the wispy clouds and the sun glistened its slopes 


Every Friday brings with it corporate happy hours and people rushing to get the train out of the city  rooftop gatherings and the beginnings of drunken adventures that might eventually turn into drunken Saturday’s  Saturday’s full of promise and adventure and excitement rolls into Saturday nights as the friend who pulls you out promises it can be missed  And so  you go  to come back at 4 am and wake up to a lazy Sunday  And for a few hours  the city dissipates some of its excitement  People recheck themselves  run their errands  pop a few Advil  and prep themselves for a night of relaxing  And as Sunday night looms around  friends gather for dinner and couples go on romantic walks  individuals take baths and roommates unwind  They’re building up energy  the cabs start speeding back up 


The article talks about something I like to term  white privilege   White privilege doesn t only reflect skin color but the way a person was brought up  I was born and brought up in India yet I was fully aware of what happened on this side of the world  the music and clothes I hear or wore were a replica to that of a person living in the United States  Although not everyone in India lives the same life  I was amongst the few in this country to have the privilege  Thinking this  I thought my move to America for college would be flawless  After all  I knew the culture and what was that thing that people kept saying  Oh yes  the amount of Asians and Indians that dominated the country  

In a school as diverse as the University of Washington  I still found an unbelievable amount of segregation  Friendships seemed to be forged on your appearance and skin color  And the worst was when I went to the counseling center after a tough winter quarter  only for a counselor to blatantly point out my skin tone and call Indians snake charmers—something I had thought was an ideological myth and not an actual belief held by people  

It s like something died within me  I am not sure if it hasn t hit me yet or if I am avoiding it or if I am actually truly numb  I don t know why I have to go back to school  I want to but at the same time don t want to  I don t want to have to deal with my future and people and figure this out  God  the people  I am not ready for this  


And there is the sadness  indian artist portraits  have such beautiful work  The thing commended is the object not the artist  It’s like saying Mona Lisa is everything and forgetting who created the masterful piece  


Tomorrow is my birthday
Tomorrow is my birthday 
I don’t like my birthday very much  It’s always something that has made me sad 
We celebrate a day of our lovely possessions  What we own  what we got  who we have in our life  our friends  the gifts they’ve given us 
It’s the one day you can flaunt about everything good in the world  Then why is it that every time my birthday comes around I think of everything I don’t have  Of every way that my life is going wrong  Why is it that I become horribly depressed and feel unloved  Even when I am in my parents’ home  Even when they do the things like cakes and such 
Why is a day that is meant to be about me not really about me at all  Why is it about the people that have wished me and the people that have come into my life and the things they’ve got me and the grand gestures they’ve done  Why can’t I just curl up with a book and be left alone 
Why do I always feel worthless on my birthday 
Lately my birthday is a reminder that the day of my birth is not a day of happiness for me but a day of my happiness for my parents — their first born made it to 23 
I however feel horrible  And I can’t even cry 
Maybe that’s why I cried so much last year  Because I want to cry every year  But I am always around people that make it difficult to cry  And last year  well last year I wasn’t 

Self preservation
Something can be said to my self preservation tactics  I shut down  not think about it  think about everything else but the thing I should probably be thinking about it  Is this everyone s defense mechanism  And if so  is it really healthy to live with this much pent up regret  anxiety  and constant need for analysis 
Every time something bad happens  I stop talking  I stop thinking  And then I put up a smile but my brain is shut  I think I learnt this form my mom  I have done it so much over the years its just something my body does on its own  And now  I recognize my mom doing it  Maybe I did learn this from her  Maybe my eyes aren t as vacant as hers yet but no doubt  it will get there 
Its not depression or sadness or want is difficult for me to define  Getting out of it  and talking about it is what s difficult  How am I meant to tell my parents that have provided me with everything that I am not happy  That I am up at odd hours  thinking of the best way to die  How do I answer the question of  what do you not have figured out  without saying everything and running into a wall 
Its true  there are good things  And i wish I could just count those good things  But its the bad things  the difficult things that haunt me everyday  Every night  I lay in bed with my eyes closed  feeling alone  and with my thoughts  they all come back  The heartbreak  the wells of tears  the fears  I don t know how to move past it  I ve tried  I ve tried to talk to myself rationally and tried to think it through  But my self preservation tactic kicks in on its own  and it screams  And I shut down  Its all dark 
What I ve not figured out — is me  I thought I would be happy when I was 23  I thought I wouldn t have my dark demon  I thought I would smile and laugh and be light and carefree  That s what I haven t figured out  That s the part I can t seem to figure out — me  And me wanting to breathe  me wanting to get up in the morning  When I was 17  I didn t think I would make it to 23  But if I did make it to 23  I thought of myself having left behind all of this 
I think voicing this  telling someone this will help me  I know it will  But I am scared  I don t know for what but I am scared  And then another voice in me tells me that I know what others will say  I know exactly what advice they will give me — to fucking shut up and deal with it and move on  So what s the point  But really  how do you tell someone this  I can t even fathom sitting down and having this conversation with someone  Not my parents  not my sister  not my family  My friends love me but I just don t want to burden them with this  And that brings up the whole childhood  trust issues  trauma  The idea that people are there in good times  but not the bad 
Good times and not the bad — that s another idea where my self preervation instincts kick in  People always said it matters that people stand by you in your bad times  not the good  But then I had people leave in my bad times  When I told them of my needs and wasn t able to hold only theirs  they stopped being my friend  And it happened  over and over again  Until I became desensititzed  I dealt with it and realized if I can t have them stand by me in bad times  at least they will stand be me in good times  And then comes around my birthday  and no one remembers  and there we go with that theory  People don t stand with you in good times either  At the end of the day  you really are a fucking lonely mess that you have to deal with  no one else  And so my preservation instincts kick in and I try my damned hardest to not shut down but it happens  And when it can t happen  I snap 
How do you tell someone you love this  Someone that gave birth to you  Someone you love  I don t have that much courage  I know this knowledge will break their heart  they will look at me differently  And so  I don t tell them  I don t tell anyone  I live with it  I pick myself apart and glue myself together  I think about how I did it now and I will do it again  And then one day I wake up and its alright  I am not going to break  and then the next comes and I feel steady ground and I can prepare for lift off  And I fill like a hot air balloon and slowly rise  taking in the scenes  And then one stupid bird with a sharp beak comes and punctures a tiny bubble  and its off to my death I go  I crash faster than I rose and I break apart into more pieces than last time  And the whole cycle begins again  I put myself together  glue it piee by piece  Again and again and again  But now  I odn t know how much longer I cna go with this  I can feel the small fine dust is lost and I can see the cracks  I can see the balloon is unpatchable because its so distorted  And I am worried one day I will blow and I will be irreparable  I worry about that day 
Yet  I don t know what to do  I don t know how to help or ask for help  I wish I was taught how to ask for help 
Maybe this is why A Little Life impacted me the way it did  This concept of hidden suffering  the idea that no matter what  how much you might want to trust someone  you can t  The idea that you can t burden someone else with your burden  The concept of being one perosn on the outside without ever truly showing just how broken you are on the inside is one I ve struggled with for most of my conscious adult life  At least from the age of 12  and now  I don t know another way 

Times Square is never dark  which is crazy  It’s so shocking  Could be a metaphor for how life always has something to give  Constantly trying to look up even when it may seem too dark 

wow The setting  Rockefeller center somewhere in the back  Empire State Building in the front with the lights going off  and to the left  hidden by the trees the Chrysler building  right by the fountain  People are here with friends and only one person  G themselves  It’s truly something  Just take a minute and look up  look how the lights shine for you  This is the o oh slciyh in the world    maybe Dubai    maybe Paris    maybe London  where the lights on all night shouldn’t be a crime  Everywhere else  it’s a crime  I love this city  This  This freedom of walking in a city at 10pm is what I am going to miss  Everything else I can get in Bangalore and more  But this  this feeling I log walking aimlessly until I figure it out is what I am going to miss  The constant activity brings you safety  I don’t even know what else to say but it’s this absolute utter beautiful feeling of freedom that I absolutely love and am going to miss 

I strongly believe their somethings that you have to learn outside of class  While in London I took part in multiple societies and clams while I was studying English literature  I was part of creative pro bono agency as well as a Tech society  I went to multiple hackathons both on campus and off campus hoping to gain as much information as possible  Over the summer while working with Vernacular AI not only did I work with use experience and data I also worked with the CTO in learning the basic architecture of How Machine learning works and the architecture of their software working in the small team  Working in the small team really helped build my perspective alongside that I worked on multiple freelancing projects over the summer and then personally the next step  I wish to play the Google because in my opinion the next step I need is a structured guidance that but only a big company can provide in particular  Most importantly I want to be able to work under a team of advisors to tell me how I can approach things differently I am  I have always been very learning individual and I believe working with professionals in creating something bigger but I had to word a bigger project is the ultimate next step for my future  Will put me a part  What puts me apart from other individuals is my drive and passion for attack  Combined with the articulate knowledge of understanding and overthinking that an English degree provides  While at college I have continued to take web design courses and you Xclusive as pie as part of my informatics my alarm I hope in the next coming year I hope to convert convert my minor into a major 


How far will you go before you break  Before it’s too much  How unsettled do you need to be 
We define ourselves and our experiences based on others   perceptions and thoughts and feelings  Precedence 
How many times will you go to the edge and retreat  How far in will you retreat 
This time you have to go into your cave  you have to retreat  and this time you have to jump off the edge  You have to take your risk and put in the time and energy to mould that Diamond  Because if not now then when 


I sat there listening to her talk and I had no idea what was running through her mind but as she talked about her broken pieces 6 I felt it deep within me  My experiences were completely different from hers but there was something in her pain that I felt  Something about the way she described about her broken pieces  her immovability  her lack of self esteem and personal confidence  I felt her pain like I felt mine  Talking to her and watching her in that state reminded me of the pain I was in about 2 years ago  Here I was  talking to someone twice my age about abuse and while hers was physical in a relationship  I understood her because I was in friendships that were abusive  Friendships that broke down my self esteem with every passing year  I felt her broken pieces and her loneliness  Her pain is very different from mine  very emotionally draining from mine  But the effect—the effect was intersectional  The pain and feelings we feel are one and the same  because that’s what depression does to you  

He was the kindest person I knew  Thinking about forgiveness makes me think of him  It’s funny though  how we think about people after their passing  How a sadness brings people together  It wasn’t that I didn’t think of him when he was alive  rather it was the fact that I took it for granted  I took life for granted  But I swear  this thing is far too short and far too cruel  It comes to the people who deserve it the least and who probably want it the least too  It’s almost his birthday and I can’t stop thinking about it  My nana was the nicest person ever   I want to be just a little nice as him  Without me knowing it  he taught me the importance of forgiveness   the importance of self worth 


It’s a cold winters day
And the sun plays with the clouds—
Dancing and skirting leaving glimpses of sun
In places too far away  

I walk along the coast  
Watching the water splash on the rocks 
And recede 
Splash and recede  

I watch the water trickle
In between the stones  
The clear water skirting 
Glimpses of the seabed with every splash  

I follow the coast line 
As far as I can—
And just as I watch a ray of sun 
Hit the rocks a little way away—
I see the warm golden hue spread like warmth  
I feel the warmth  
Trickling in me much like water 
trickles between stones
I feel the hush of comfort and safety
The golden warm hue
Even in the face of blistering cold winds  

Loss
Its so weird experiencing loss because you don’t know if this is how you actually feel about the person if you’re fantasizing and making them to be larger than they actually are 


The city never really does sleep  With the reflection of city lights on the sky  
It lights the sky in a cool pink  
Never really sleeping 
A constant state of light reminding you 
That day isn’t over 
And so the days flow one into the other 

We are a piece of history 
Slotting into the world like little pieces of a puzzle 
Forgetting what has come before us  

Even today we talk about the breaking 
The change in weather  geography
Imagine when the lands were shifting 


In the distance
I saw the buildings light up—golden
I walked under the grey skies
But somehow the sun parted
Somewhere in the distance 
Shining those few rays
On the buildings
In the distance
They lit up—
Golden  

I think sometimes we think we can sit down and just figure everything out and that it all has to line up and it’s going to be ok  But it’s not how it works  It takes time and effort and energy to build yourself up  It takes an approach of recognizing your vices and constantly working on ourselves  We are a more conscious generation and I think that’s because of the amount of time we spend working on ourselves  to better ourselves 
I think we try to find a reason for why we’re broken and we try to blame specific instances in our life for them  Sometimes it’s nothing but other times it’s everything  How do you reconcile with who you are and who you are becoming 
My mom is going through perimenopause which makes her anger absolutely horrible  Mix that with her sadness and it’s kind of unbearable to be around her  But one of the things I’ve found myself saying is ‘calm down ’ ‘keep yourself calm ’ ‘control yourself ’ It’s that last one that really makes me think — ‘control yourself’ woman — a jibe hundreds and thousands of men have used towards women to make them feel inferior and less  Is it fair for one woman to use towards another woman 
There is a rawness to vulnerability that I haven’t been able to come to terms with  How do you keep pushing yourself and your self worth when you are so confused and overwhelmed  Isn’t it time to ask myself what I want  What I truly want  Am I wasting time 
That question — am I wasting time  — has been replaying in my head for the past 6 months  I keep seeing people get amazing jobs and positions out of college  I keep seeing people party and have fun  And in all honesty  it’s hitting me hard  I didn’t want that life right now but is this the life I wanted  Sitting in my bed all day  not working on anything  Where is my ambition  I am broken and I feel even more broken when I see this  When will I stop measuring myself to others in the world and just focus on me — focus on what I want — on where I want to be  Isn’t this the time to do that 
Trauma  How do you recognize your own trauma  Is it when you take a step back and then come back to the thick of it 
I have seen people scream and shout at each other for years  There is no unity and how do yo7 get to an answer  How do you speak for someone else when you can’t even speak for yourself 
Being back in Bangalore has been very interesting for me  I knew I never fit in in high school  but I kept telling myself stories and others how close I was to some people so that I could make it up  Honestly  I am tired of it  I am tired of lying to myself and others around me  I don’t like some people and they don’t like me  But honestly  I never put in the effort it needed 
So  I’ve been sitting here worrying about what I am going to do on New Years because no 22 year old should spend it at home  I should go out and see my friends and drink with them and enjoy and live my best life  Right  That’s what’s tradition demands  That’s what’s expected  When people ask me what I did  I have to tell them I got all dressed up and went to a party with my high school friends and had fun  Because that’s what happens  isn’t it  But it isn’t what I want to do  I am sitting here and constantly thinking and stressing about it  because I don’t want to be that “loser” but honestly I don’t want to go drink with random people  I think I want to be invited to it more than I want to go to it  But what’s new  That’s how I have lived most of my life  In this halfway place between dreams and consciousness 
I am able to stand here today and I know that there is something wrong with me  I know that but I don’t know how to help myself  I am still terrified to face my demons 
The following are pieces from my journal from July 2022 to present about quality of living 

The narratives that we tell ourselves in exchange for the fear of living life and feeling emotions  
All I ve ever wanted is a community of people that support and love my endeavors  
I am so caught up in things of elsewhere   the past  another place  another time  another scenario that I forget to exist in the now  the present  
I don t have people around me who have the mindset that I am in currently   need to find that  
My room is still a heaping blazing disaster zone  
The simple pleasures are the little  subway rides late at night with friends  musicians on the subway  watching the sun set  
Finally I am in a position where I can say I love and believe in myself  
Not showing up  Isn t friendship about showing up  About putting aside this anxiety  I am in a rut and I can never get out of it  I feel like I am choosing myself but I m hiding  Isn t it courage to go  To show  To risk  Isn t that what life is    the people you meet and the stories you accumulate 
I ve wanted to die for so long that I m glad to live today  To know that I ve made it to an age I didn t think I would  to acknowledge the greed and pain and sadness that I had in life  That it wasn t a part of my imagination  To have the knowledge that I will experience all of it again maybe worse but I will have more control 
I am filled with love and gratitude and greatness today  I feel invincible  
I don t know where my time and energy has gone  
I ve been leading unto this moment of release  
I don t know what I ve been feeling  I feel restless  I feel anxious  I feel   expectant  
In the winter  when the snow falls quickly  for a second when the weather turns  it does something where we can t see far from our window  We can imagine that we aren t where we are  Maybe the city isn t the city and the building my window is facing is actually a mountain  a bit farther than it appears  each with its own cottage  neatly stacked  
I was shook because I was giving the impression that I had no family trauma  How is it so easy for someone to diminish another s trauma  I don t talk about the trauma because I don t see the point in talking about it  It s easier to talk about the good things because the bad is horrible
