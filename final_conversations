To me silence means stillness  Silence means not creation disturbance  Silence can be at different levels though  Could be silence in your actions  words  thoughts or inner being  Just because your words are silent doesn’t mean other parts of you are silent  But the deeper the silence goes the more clarity is created out of the stillness  If there is silence on the outside but not on the inside  it will mean misalignment and internal conflict 
i think silence is subjective  it can be saying what people want to hear while keeping everything you actually want to say quiet  it can be staying completely silent when your mind is the loudest thing ever  being a bystander  There are so many manifestations of silence and all of it is based on personal experience  but to me personally  silence is that feeling you get when you’re in a room full of people and you feel completely alone  when your mind is racing with thoughts to the point it becomes a numbing silence in your head  
no noise words  and having stony faces
Silence is just being comfortable without distractions  which happens so rarely 
Silence could mean reflection  just letting something sink in or truly giving space for words  actions  feelings expressed to be heard by you and others around you  
the things I had a hard time saying to my mother 
Silence means keeping things within me when I know I shouldn t say it  
No sound  absence of sound 
First there is a still clear silent lake  Nothing is changing  Millions of years it’s been like that  You drop a water  a drop of water  means it has to be a mass  suppose you drop a stone or a big drop of water  the whole lake will get disturbed  The silence of the lake will be broken  And it is going to keep on breaking the silence but if you’re at the bottom  hardly anything will happen to it  unless its so explosive  the silence cannot be broken  It is the bottom of the lake  Let’s reverse it for the human mind  Our human mind is fluttering like one drop  “Haye mere Baal kharab ho Gaye  haaye mera chehra aisa nahi hai  aare mere naak aisi nahi hai ” So we are all getting  the silence if being broken by our thought processes by our physical and external stimuli so much  unless you make it calm and quiet and go to the bottom then we can realize our own self  That is maha rishi’s perpetuity concept  Silence  
Silence takes up space or the lack of space  It is a private space  what are you thinking about  Brains and thoughts that you don’t have access to  Today there is a total lack of boundaries  I appreciate boundaries  When I interview people I fill silences so people have time to think  You have to be socially adept to understand the power of silence  Take pauses and think before revealing the answers  Curating ourselves and experiences intentionally  As a way to be intentional and take back power  A private place to go to  
power   intentionality  Deciding when and what I want to share means reclaiming power over my presence in a space  It s one of the most empowering things I can do for myself when I m entering a space I feel uncomfortable in  Its an act of self care too to be able to not allow people access to your thoughts and words rather than feeling like we owe it to people to keep talking to make them comfortable  or to answer questions even if they feel intrusive  It also means being able to pause and think about what I want to say  which has a meditative aspect that forces me to slow down when I m in an anxious spiral where I can t stop talking  and allows me to not say things I regret later 
silence means chaos  it s hard for me to be silent because all my thoughts come flooding in  so really  it s my loudest moment 
Quite literally the absence of noise  for someone who talks a lot it also sometimes correlates with a little but of uncomfortable moments  Silence for me personally is also thinking time  when I am not verbalising my thoughts and i come across as silent but i have so much running in my mind  
Silence is ambiguous to me  It can both be concentration  collaboration and a sense of focusing on something to the extend that talking is unnecessary  It can be peaceful and with contentment  It’s often said that when you can be together in silence with someone else in silence  it’s really special  I would agree  On the other hand  I find silence oppressive at times  when I don’t know how to say certain things  when feelings are soaring around my body with no words  In those instances silence can be really difficult and frustrating 
Things I skip to say  leaving it to be an awkward pause but skipping some moments of embarrassment 
Not communicating at all  revealing only partial information  not speaking up when necessary  not responding to someone s needs
Silence for me has many meanings  and I would assign each of them a different color  For example  sometimes it s comforting to have its presence  this is when it comes from a place of understanding  I would tag it with an off white color  whereas sometimes it puts you on a guilt trip when there is uncertainty  and lack of communication  so I would tag it with a dark shade of gray  
 Silence can have different meanings depending on the context  It can be a moment of tranquility  peace  and stillness  providing an opportunity for reflection  introspection  and relaxation  Silence can also be a form of respect  allowing others to express themselves without interruption or interference  It can be a way to listen actively  paying attention to others and the environment  fostering understanding and connection 
On the other hand  silence can also signify discomfort  awkwardness  or tension in social situations  where unspoken emotions or thoughts may be present  It can represent a lack of communication or a breakdown in dialogue  potentially signifying misunderstandings or conflicts  Silence can also be associated with secrecy  reservation  or hidden emotions  where unexpressed thoughts or feelings may be kept concealed 
To me silence is peace  To me silence is comfort  But at the same time  silence also means being silenced to me  To be stripped of the basic right of expressing yourself the way you deserve to  Silence to me is order and chaos all at once  At times all you need is silence to make sense of the chaos happening in and around you  and sometimes you need the same silence to be broken to ensue some much needed chaos  
Silence means listening  Listening deepl so that I can find spaces to smile  
Silence is a universal language  It is the liminal negative space that exists for the sublime to occur  
Sometimes it s that crazy tension between two people  sometimes it s a calm environment where you feel safe  and sometimes it s loneliness 
Silence is to not think
It means being my truest version of myself
Silence scares me a little because it can make me feel alone  At the same time  I feel that silence helps me become more centered and in tune with myself  even if it’s uncomfortable at first 
 Silence can be a way of fitting in  Of resting  not fighting a battle to be heard or understand  The relief of going unnoticed and not causing any friction  
Sometimes it’s also comfortable  especially when experiencing a star lit night  the sea or just reading a book  doing our own things around other people   
Not having an inner dialogue or having a thought  Having it be quiet around me  
Quiet time to think  awkward moments in the air  pause before a blow out fight  scary movies
Silence is stillness 
When you are engaged with nothing  Total zero space  No chattered with people  Meditative state  Focused on one singular thing  
Negative space but also the thing that exists all around you  
Stillness and calm 
Comfort and being in the interdependence  Learning about somebody through silent ways and how you can be  
Silence is comfort and knowing how to love and being interdependent  
Silence can be a choice  imposed  it s not passive  It s active always  There is no passivity in it  although by definition or by effect it seems passive  especially if you re intentional with your silence   But then silence is also a gift  you re listening  you re processing  I don t think silence  I don t know what we re mapping  how the other end is  but whatever it is  the absence of noise to noise  I don t think one has weight over the other  I think that is situational  When silence is imposed  it can be imposed  it can be oppressive  When silence is imposed its imposed  When you aren t silent you have to think about volume  amplification and reach  and the dynamics of when you break silence  where does that go  What does silence look like  Is it a physical structure around you that is restricting you  Is it mental  because most of the time it is mental  Your silence is feeding the disorder itself  you re not feeding yourself  you re feeding it everytime you let it do  Self inflicted silence is hard to grasp sometimes  
Silence to me is the removal or void of sound
Honestly I don t like too much of silence  I would link silence with meditation  focus or concentration  The meaning of silence has evolved over time  In childhood it was equivalent to  calm before the storm    As I grew up  I understood that silence could also be comforting  And in my current life stage it is about peace of mind   
Everything  I spend 80  of my day in silence and I have even chose to live in a property where I have access to a lot of silence  I dont like the hustle and noise on the roads and Im not big on travelling either  I like doing deep work and work can be anything  If you meet me  you wondnt call me an introvert and nor am I an introvert  Its just that I believe my thoughts are precious and I can only access the full potential of my thoughts when there is silence around 
Silence is both a boon and a bane  It is the representation of both comfort and anger depending on who the person is  When by myself  silence is peaceful and like homecoming to me  
Peace  rest  moments of introspection  the state of being alone and at times loneliness 
 It means so many things and is not strictly auditory  And these things can be contradictory  For one  it can feel uncomfortable or peaceful  Or you can feel silence when you are in a loud locale  Personally  it’s most powerful when  1  nothing is interrupting my internal monologue  and  2  when this monologue is a peaceful  inspired  and creative  As is probably obvious  my dominant feelings about silence are positive  
But when with other people it’s strange that silence can seem so hostile and awkward  and an anxiety stimulant  Or in other contexts  it can mean something detrimental say  silencing voices that need to be heard  
emptiness  the lack of something  almost hollow
silence means being very peaceful and present and a quiet mind  I think being able to embrace silence is a really valuable skill in 2023 given how many mechanisms there are to avoid silence  and also it can be more of a  state of mind  rather than literal silence   for example I feel like I am able to have  inner silence  even on a busy subway or busy nyc street I silence the things I don’t think are acceptable to be said openly  I silence myself from saying things that I think might hurt people  I silence the part of myself that I think others might not relate to  
There are so many parts of myself that i silence and i think it depends on who i am talking to  It changes from person to person  the person i am to family is not the same as the one i am to my friends  and this is a byproduct of silence the parts that need to be silenced when i am with certain groups of people  
parts of myself that i am insecure about i hide  
I m thinking about the ways in which I perform in friendships and why I am silent about the ways in which I silence the things that aren t going well so I don t seem like the debby downer and don t bring down the group s vibe but I m not being honest and truthful about how I am and I think it s a suffocating silence and one that feels very self betraying  There s so much comfort with people you know but it also has so many learned boundaries over time that sometimes it feels easy to open up to a stranger in a way that you can t with a close friend because they might be involved or have passed judgement previously  It s taken me a long time to be comfortable in silence with anyone other than my partner old roommates  but when it happens it s the best feeling 
Silence for me represents the feeling of understanding  Having moved around and not always fit it  I used to be forced into being silent since no one would engage with me  This would manifest into anxiety and almost over corrective form of speaking  talking and engaging with others around yourself to make sure it is not you being rejected by them this time around  It can be very stressful and panic enduring to always have something to say  and also can come off as over sharing thinking back on it  Which is why silence with friends and partners can mean comfort for some as well  
I never told my parents about my eating disorder 
I type up messages that I never press send on  When I miss someone I open up their old text messages and type up a message but never press send on it  
I don t tell people things because I am worried about their judgment towards me 
I try to make my mind calm and quiet  What someone else says and does is not what I am looking for  
People aren’t entitled to our thoughts and reactions and remove yourself from the situation 
I think silence can be a manipulative act  not in a bad way  between strangers  and a way to set boundaries  By choosing what we want to reveal and what we leave unsaid we paint a picture of how we want to be perceived  Those that know us can see through that barrier easily  those that don t can t  The things I leave unsaid between friends are either things I know they can infer without me saying anything  or as a preventative measure if there are things I know may hurt them  It s interesting to think about silence through generations  We do not have a lot of family history because nobody ever bothered to write it down or to pass down stories through generations  and so silence has erased the past in many ways  with each death a tidal wave that removes the footprints from the beach  That silence has made me work harder to fill in the blanks  with the scraps that I do know or through my imagination  My mother has always remained mysterious and elusive to me  She was a master of not revealing details  or casually saying things that carried a lot of weight  but doing it in passing as though what she said was nothing of importance at all  In turn I grew up to be a very chatty person  and a person that word vomits personal information in every conversation  and I think that maybe the reason I do this is to leave a bread crumb trail  Maybe I m scared that my footprints will be washed away  or maybe I m hoping someone will follow the breadcrumb trail right back to who I am at my core because I felt like I never got the chance to do that with my parents
i silence my weaknesses  I don t share it unless I absolutely have to 
I am definitely not a fan of silence  but I dont mean constant talk   even some white noise  the fan moving or even some traffic noises  With people around  sometimes silence is necessary but a lot of times it makes me feel more conscious 
I think silences were the norm in previous generations  I have seen equations where things that were to be addressed were ignored and in turn just became emotional baggage that effects them years later  I think in the current generation its an active choice   when do I choose to be silent and when does it do me more harm   be it in personal equations or even when standing up for your values on the internet 
I often silence my opinions or my wishes and needs  Maybe I don’t think they’re important  I don’t always do this  but it’s certainly a pattern  
I think intrusive thoughts are left unsaid  sometimes confessed out of guilt  the idea of your identity and confusions around it  especially if you re on the LGBTQ  spectrum
People stay silence because of a number of reasons   fear of being judged  fear of the other person s reaction or inability to handle certain facts or truths  fear of offending someone or calling them out on something  staying silent in order to avoid conflict altogether   
People are naturally more likely to stay silent in situations involving unknown people they ve just met since they are generally not aware of the person s background are not sure of their opinions and values don t want to offend them would rather just avoid any possible conflict or disagreement  For people you ve known for a long time  its much easier to open up and share without being judged  its easier to address issues that you might not be ok with  its easier to empathize and understand by speaking out 
I have recently realized withdrawing from the everyday events of life  It s challenging to silence my thoughts  because that is an internal process  but I have found myself limiting interaction with people I like talking with  including my family members 
Why do people hide parts of themselves  Maybe because they do not want to be judged based on a certain perception  This could be a phase  but having different opinions from multiple people is overwhelming at times 
Sometimes I choose to silence my true emotions or thoughts when communicating with others  There are various situations when I chose to remain silent but the primary reason is usually a desire to avoid conflict  Sometimes it s just easier to not speak your mind and avoid confrontation  It s a matter of picking one s battles  This often happens with people I ve known for longer  or older adults who might misinterpret my words expression 
When it comes to social situations  the things that are left unspoken to a stranger often stem from a desire to maintain personal boundaries and protect myself from being vulnerable  How much I reveal depends on the situation and I choose to remain silent if I feel that the conversation is getting too personal too fast 
Silence can also be influenced by generational or cultural norms  In some cultures  silence may be valued as a form of respect  humility  or politeness  where individuals may choose to remain silent rather than express themselves openly  In other cases  silence may be a result of intergenerational patterns or societal conditioning  where certain topics or emotions are considered taboo or off limits  and individuals may feel the need to suppress or hide certain aspects of themselves or their experiences 
Understanding silence can be complex  as it requires interpreting non verbal cues  context  and cultural nuances  Reading silence involves paying attention to body language  facial expressions  and other non verbal cues to infer underlying emotions or thoughts  However  interpreting silence can also be subjective and may vary depending on individual perspectives and biases  
The parts of myself that I silence aren t many  but they re significant  I silence my desires  I silence my dreams  I silence my fantasies  And I silence the opinion that if people knew these parts of me too  I d be viewed in a totally different light than the one now  
The dark parts of people  or the parts that others can take advantage of are the parts that are usually hidden by people in my experience  And I understand this clearly because this is something that I ve been practising for a very long time now  Silence is many times the precaution that I prefer choosing over the cure  
When you share a part of yourself with someone in conversation  you are silently inviting someone to open up to you and for people to get to know you better  
I m having troubles expressing my own needs   wants  Even I don t want to do something  I don t tell that to people  Or when I m mad sad about something or someone  I don t confront  Feelings grow inside me and I feel the weight on me  To answer the question  I would say that I m silencing my emotions  
i read a lot that we should sit in our feelings  The best thing a writer or any artist can do is sit in their feelings  It’s so easy to distract myself and think of things I should be doing and can be doing  But instead I should be working  dedicating time to the thing that I want to be remembered for  
Humans crave community  They want companionship and people  I am a hugger  And a true hug  a true meaningful hug  I can’t remember the last time I received one  It’s so much easier to focus on what could bes  The community that you could have rather than focusin on the community that you have  I was wrecked by the pandemic  I see it now   in the remnants of the crystal clear broken glass  I have to rebuild myself  build myself into the person I want to be now  a year from now  5 years from now  I feel trampled on 
I fundamentally changed the last few years and I don’t know who I am anymore or what I want anymore  It was cute when I was in high school or college  But now I just feel pathetic and lost  I don’t know who I am and I came to this conclusion too late  I was pushed into meeting hundreds of new people with whom I was this pseudo half self and I saw my friends that I had being the self I used to be  Neither of these was who I am  Is who I am  And so it’s been so hard to not break or shatter because I’ve gone through this entire summer  the past year  with this idea of who I am and who I should be and the things I should want because that’s what people around me want  Everyone changed because of the pandemic   I know that  But how are they still while when I feel so broken  If we are a reflection of the people that we hangout with and if we are a reflection of the closest people that we surround ourselves with then who am I  Because lately I’ve been hanging out with just myself by design  And I am going a little crazy  I don’t know how to get out of that monotony  I look back at a lot of eras of my life and say “remember when I used to be friends with X    ” and hang out with Y  I don’t want to do that  I am worthy of loving  That is not the thing that is up for debate  The thing that is is my response to it  How do I respond to this and how do I move past this and how do salvage who I am  How do I figure that out  
The people that are going to add value to your life will exist in your life regardless of what you do  You have to remember who is adding your 
Loneliness is hanging out with your friend and on a subway car filled with people  
It can be my guilty pleasures  something that I don t want someone to know because of how they will perceive me  
I silence the parts of myself that could be perceived as embarrassing  unlikable  or simply make me more vulnerable  I do this with everyone except for my closest loved ones  I think I hide these aspects of my personality to prevent myself from getting hurt  
I guess I silence ideas i haven’t heard before  unsure of their consequences  their effects  Or thoughts that I feel another person wouldn’t understand  Sometimes  I don’t say things to people I’ve known for a long time because I’m afraid if they know how much I’ve changed  or not changed   they won’t like me anymore  Sometimes I don’t say something because i want to protect it without justifying it with arguments like I’m in a battle  It’s easier to say these things to a person i’ve just met  and who i likely may not meet again  because it takes some of the pressure off  We don’t know each other  we don’t owe each other  we care less about what the other person thinks of us  Recently  like this week   I’ve discovered i can say these silencdd things to friends too  and they might understand or try to  
Across generations  i think I just silence things that widens the generation gap  but occasionally chip away at the edge  I’m not very good at understanding through reading silence  not during conversations at least  It sticks with me though  and I keep hoping I would understand it next time  
Fear of judgement or retaliation  I feel more comfortable talking about most things with people I ve known for a while  A lot of things go unspoken around new people 1  because im naturally introverted 2  i may feel that its inappropriate to over share
I used to silence myself and presented a version I’d like myself to be around friends  Not so much now  I normally don’t omit much between people I first meet or known for a while  My non existing filter has brought some laughs and some judgements  which I don’t think I cared after thinking about it for 5mins   I don’t like to but I silence my romantic relationship from my parents  and every time I wanted to share more I ended up remember why I silence it  I think my parent’s generation silence more than my generation  I don’t think I understand what it means for a product to read silence  If it’s figuring out things left unsaid  I think it’s better from a considerate perspective than spying on me  
the part that I am worried due to judgment 
 My silence is to the parts of myself that I don t like  I am editing the parts of me  One thing that is left unspoken is the intuitive feeling that every human being has to be happy  to love one another  and to feel good  Feel in a good state that good state feeling of when you are healthy  Feeling when your sense are responding to positive manner  It s a human experience  Any religion  Experiencing in bliss  that s silence  
True love is silently reflects in your conversations  The feelings you feel everyday are all silent  What you feel in a relationship is what silently reflects itself onto the quality of the relationship you have with people 
its about how to learn each others behaviors in a comfortable way because I observe strangers when I am on the subway which is noisy and stuff but as long as we are not communicating with each other I can observe them  Is that the main thing or is silence the main thing  Another thing I thought of was the James Terrell room in MoMa PS1  He dug out a hole in the ceiling  a room with a hole in the sky  they jus look at the sky and its very silent inside  people are very conscious of their voice in that space  That is another space where silence is created and there is also comfort but of course more functional space where there is silence is like a church  where its absolutely silent but you need to be silent out of respect  SO I think the question is  what is essentially the silent represent  Silence itself as a subject or silence as the nonverbal communication that they have  or the feelings that people have when they are in silent space with other people  
 both like church and James Turrell room a lot  Church is sharing a respectfulness or something and feel that other people are being accountable  James Terrell  its more like a meditation  I just generally like silence 
Silent dialog  To me  that’s what keeps coming up  less about erasure and more about what happens in silent spaces  This unspoken or what is not verbalized  or made tangible in a silent space  Turrell and church is interesting  When I went to Turrell  we understood what was happening and being very quiet  When church  I go with other people  I am stressed about them not being quiet  I am ok being quiet  but I am worried they will not be quiet and be disrespectful  That is an interesting distinction  How do you create a space that is void of obligation but sets a tone and sets rule  The Turrell room doesn’t have rooms but does  But it also kind of does  
With eating disorders specifically  it was a very secretive disorder  If you tell someone else about it  then you are betraying that disorder and the hold it has on your mind  It s like a leech in your mind  That s why talking about it and sharing your experience is very important  That dynamic can be mapped to mental health where people are silently suffering and we can ask why but especially when we are dealing with family trauma  A lot of my silence comes from my trauma is not as bad as someone else s trauma so it doesn t really matter  What I am going through is not as bad as someone else is going so it doesn t really matter  It s putting it on myself too  
Breaking up silence in trauma family cycles is not something that we feel like it is our job but it is  That s when the bystander effect comes in that someone else will take care of it  What happens when everyone says that  So when you instantiate the bystander effect  silence is perpetuated and normalized but you have to take it into your hands especially in family because when you rbeak cycles  its because you re saying something and it requires you to break silence because silence is what continues the cycles  It continues on what happens when you break the silence because a lot of the times we are complacent about building after we take the first step  We ve done enough when we ve brought it up but I think we have to remember to keep breaking the silence because that s what normalizes the opening of the line of communication  
I am a huge proponent of not wasting words  I have been surrounded by so many useless words that I have made it a point to be intention with the words that we use  materializing words can help  do other things  as a human organism on the planet  we need to take into consideration  the words that we use  I am a visual learner  we are not taking visual communication into being  silent films are so effective because of physical language  not just oral and written communications  words as communication then physical  my rules are to not hear what they say but watch we do  words are the container of the actions we do  When you take action we re breaking silence  silence is not passive  opening up lines of communication in family   strengthens in any dynamic  because I think that strengthens any dynamic  like clear communication  in my longest relationships  we have broken our silence and opened those lines of communications to then continue to live together  we have built a relationship that is sustainable and pleasant  that s what strengthens relationships  if you never break the silence then you are perpetuating the frustrations  thats human to human situation too you ought to seek or want to understand other perspectives  that s where your silence is active in listening and act of processing and understanding another perspective  
I think a lot of people are suffering in silence because they are not extending themselves to others  a lot of people don t find community because they think their perspective doesn t matter  silence is the sharing of your self 
I silence my opinions often because I m afraid to be wrong or for others to perceive me in a negative way  I silence my honesty sometimes because I want others to view me in a positive light  I silence my opinions because that s what I was taught to do  But sometimes  I stay silent because I am comfortable  I silence myself because I want to learn more about the people around me  I am silent so I can empathize and console  
I believe in clear communication  I never silence my feelings with people I am close to  The moment I sense some discomfort or negativity with a peer  colleagues or anyone not close enough then I try to maintain distance and go silent  
I think people don t express enough gratitude for having each other 
I m guessing thats called diplomacy  fortunately or unfortunately I am unable to do that 
I m not sure will ponder upon it more    
Again  depending on the person or environment  I choose to silence the bolder  as perceived by society  thoughts of mine  I usually silence parts of me which i feel will not be understood by the other  It s also an indication of defeat if I choose silence after attempts at communicating  In my personal experience  silence has been an alternating characteristic in the sense that  someone with loud parents has gone on to become quieter and then their kids seem to be loud extroverted yet sensitive again 
 I silence the parts of myself that make others uncomfortable  I silence what is weird  not mainstream  etc  I silence my pain and overwhelming emptions
I use silence to hide a lot of flaws about myself from the world  I believe hide parts of ourselves in fear of social rejection but also this can minimize the joy we experience  And may prevent us from being vulnerable  and connecting with other people on a deep emotional plane  I think this generation is becoming more vocal in many ways  especially through the destigmatization of therapy and talking about our personal struggles  There are so many strange anxieties I have developed throughout my life due to this silencing of cultural “taboos”  
I think that silence can be looked at in so many ways  both as a powerful tool and a deafening obstacle  It is defined by the context that it’s in   Silence between friends or lovers is comfortable meanwhile silence at dinner with your family is tense  In conversation  especially amongst strangers  the words we silence are topics that make people around us generally uncomfortable  As social creatures  we lean towards acceptance and that makes sense  But  amongst friends there is a known level of comfort and I think that silence still exists here   it just takes the form of silence in different topics  emotions  and you silence what you are uncomfortable saying  In the end  I guess my silence is led by how comfortable I feel in an environment  
Different cultures and places around the world carry different views   this affects the way that silence seeps through us  We learn through what we hear  which is a product of our environment  With the emergence or social media  I think that there will be less silence where it matters and words will be heard and generational silencing around stigmatized topics will reduce  
People try not to offend people  are constantly reading situations and reading the  vibe  of the conversation to see how much of them they can reveal  I think meeting someone new I m a lot more hyper aware of nuances in the conversation and am more filtered vs I m more relaxed with older friends or if ive gone through some kind of defining experience w a newer friend
